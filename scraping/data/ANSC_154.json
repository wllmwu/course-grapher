  "description": "This course explores the intersections of religion and gender. Focusing on modern Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, we will address such questions as: How and why are gender and sexuality significant in the context of religious beliefs and practices? Why do religions place so much emphasis on defining proper gender roles for women and men? How do nonheterosexual people of faith grapple with religious ideologies that reject LGBTQ ways of life? Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
