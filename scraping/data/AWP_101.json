  "description": "Students write about scientific topics for non-scientific audiences, engaging with current debates in the sciences, analyzing the rhetorical strategies employed, and composing rhetorically strategic responses of their own. Students also make short multi-modal presentations to practice delivering what they have written. The intensive focus on writing and revising is especially useful for students who want to develop their writing. Prerequisites: upper-division or graduate standing."
