  "description": "This seminar focuses on how differences between groups of people, and the patterns of power, exclusion and conflict resulting from such differences, become embedded in geographical landscapes. The course examines place-based sites of difference, power, and conflict beginning with the map, and moving through such spatial environments as the body, the city, the nation, the landscape, the reservation, culminating in borderland conflict here in our own backyard. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
