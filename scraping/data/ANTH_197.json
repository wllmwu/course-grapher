  "description": "The Department of Anthropology\u00a0has partnered\u00a0with the Academic Internship Program (AIP) at UC San Diego to provide students with internship opportunities during their undergraduate studies. The AIP allows students to integrate academic theory and \u201creal world\u201d practice, engage in research that explores the relationship between the two, and gain hands-on experience in a professional setting. By participating, students receive ANTH 197 (P/NP) credit while fulfilling the requirements of the Academic Internship Program Office. In order to pursue this internship, you will need to have a faculty mentor\u00a0from the anthropology department. Students will be responsible to follow the requirements outlined in the AIP syllabus, as well as plans established with the\u00a0faculty mentor."
