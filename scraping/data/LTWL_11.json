  "description": "This course explores representations of health, medicine, and the body across a historically and culturally diverse range of texts. We will examine how authors and artists use illness, disability, and wellness as themes and motifs in their work, and discuss how these representations not only reflect but also shape attitudes and beliefs about health."
