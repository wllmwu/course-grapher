It will also provide a number of hands-on examples of how \u201cnew media\u201d work to speed the process of political mobilization, coalition formation, the persistence of clandestine networks, and issues of transparency and translation, with particular implications for urban warfare and insurgency. Renumbered from IRGN 429. Students may not receive credit for GPPS 42 and IRGN 429."
