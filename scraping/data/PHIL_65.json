  "description": "This course explores how language and power intersect by critically examining the often unnoticed ways that our language reflects, reinforces, and reshapes the power structures that surround us. Examples of questions discussed include: How does power influence ideas about what is the \u201cright\u201d way to speak? How do in-group and out-group uses of slurs differ? How does language reflect and reinforce social stereotypes? Should our language change in order to promote social aims, and if so, how?"
