  "description": "Course provides an introduction to the design and control of haptic systems, which provide touch feedback to human users interacting with virtual environments and teleoperated robots. Topics include haptic-focused mechatronic design, system modeling and analysis (kinematics and dynamics), human-in-the-loop feedback control, and haptic feedback evaluation. Course topics including mechatronic system design, as well as system modeling, analysis, and control reinforce many fundamental MAE topics."
