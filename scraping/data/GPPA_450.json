  "description": "This course explores three topics: 1) democracy, which is primarily about procedural justice; 2) social policy, which is primarily about distributive justice; and, 3) corruption, which is a breach of formal justice. We will consider potential conflicts and reconciliation between justice and development, approaching various issues not just theoretically and conceptually, but also empirically and quantitatively. The course uses cross-national quantitative studies and case studies. Renumbered from IRGN 450. Students may not receive credit for GPPA 450 and IRGN 450."
