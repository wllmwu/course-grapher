  "description": "This course provides a critical revision to art history of the modern era in the Americas by bringing to the center, as an organizing principle, an expanded understanding and critique of the notion of indigenism. Presenting evidence that the constant iteration of the problem of representation of indigeneity and the indigenous is persistent across the region following a network of exchanges and contacts across art movements and political contexts. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
