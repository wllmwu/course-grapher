  "description": "This class has two goals. The first is to give students the analytic tools needed to explain why individuals, organizations, and states behave the way they do and why they choose certain actions over others. The second is to apply these tools to major policy challenges in the world today. These challenges likely include interstate and civil war, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, climate change, and the rise of artificial intelligence in conflict."
