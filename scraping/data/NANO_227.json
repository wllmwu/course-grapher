  "description": "Key concepts in the atomic structure and bonding of solids such as metals, ceramics, and semiconductors. Symmetry operations, point groups, lattice types, space groups, simple and complex inorganic compounds, structure/property comparisons, structure determination with X-ray diffraction. Ionic, covalent, metallic bonding compared with physical properties. Atomic and molecular orbitals, bands verses bonds, free electron theory. Cross-listed with MATS 227, MAE 251 and CHEM 222.\u00a0Students may only receive credit for one of the following: CHEM 222, MAE 251, MATS 227, or NANO 227.\u00a0Prerequisites: graduate standing."
