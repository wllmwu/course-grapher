  "description": "This course presents the field of bioinspired robotics and locomotion. Concepts include modes of bioinspired locomotion (walking, running, undulatory locomotion for example); limb kinematics; development of dynamic models from Euler-Lagrange, Newton\u2019s laws, manipulator equations; stability analysis of oscillatory gaits; force and compliance control of robot legs; generation of rhythmic movement and coupled oscillators. Prerequisites: MAE 204.",
