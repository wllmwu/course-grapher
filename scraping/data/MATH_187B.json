  "description": "The object of this course is to study modern public key cryptographic systems and cryptanalysis (e.g., RSA, Diffie-Hellman, elliptic curve cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, homomorphic encryption) and the mathematics behind them. We also explore other applications of these computational techniques (e.g., integer factorization and attacks on RSA). Recommended preparation: Familiarity with Python and/or mathematical software (especially SAGE) would be helpful, but it is not required. Prerequisites: MATH 187 or MATH 187A and MATH 18 or MATH 31AH or MATH 20F. Students who have not completed listed prerequisites may enroll with consent of instructor.",
