  "description": "This course introduces students to the ways in which climate change exacerbates environmental racism and inequality. We will consider the ways that structural violence and discriminatory policies create environmental inequalities where marginalized communities take on more of the risk and burdens of climate change. We will address community organizing and social justice efforts to combat the systems of power that unevenly distribute the burdens of climate change to marginalized communities. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
