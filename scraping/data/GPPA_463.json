  "description": "This course is designed to introduce the fundamentals of the energy system and outline its possible futures, including the science, engineering, and political economy of new technologies. We look at how the system is structured, the imperatives and constraints under which it operates, and how it is likely to evolve given the competing demands it serves and the range of challenges facing its technologies. A key focus of the course is innovation in creating new opportunities. Students may not earn credit for GPPA 463 and GPGN 490 with the same title."
