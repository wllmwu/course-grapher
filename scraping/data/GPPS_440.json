  "description": "Ukraine is the site of the largest conventional war in Europe since the 1940s. The course will look at history and theory to understand its causes. We will sample analytical frameworks from international relations and comparative politics that can contribute to an understanding of Russian-backed insurrection (in 2014) and full-scale war (in 2022). We will address matters of military science and social adaptation, speculating about the consequences for European and global security."
