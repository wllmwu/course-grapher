  "description": "Political debates often invoke the \u201cEuropean model,\u201d with the left extolling its political virtues as the right derides it as \u201cunworkable.\u201d Although these discussions frequently tie into political reform debates, they offer little discussion of what the \u201cEuropean political model\u201d entails. This course is designed to identify the economic, institutional, and cultural components of the \u201cEuropean political model,\u201d examining whether it provides insights for reform outside of the European context."
