  "description": "This course provides an introduction to the history and theory of museum representation of American Indians in order to explore its relation to colonialism and decolonization. In addition to a wide-ranging look at the complex foundations of systems of representing Indians and Indianness, the course includes a study of a specific art form and history of a specific Native American community that will allow the class to create new approaches to designing a museum exhibition. May be co-scheduled with ETHN 114A.",
