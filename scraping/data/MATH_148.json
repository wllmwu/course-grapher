  "description": "A rigorous introduction to partial differential equations. Topics include initial and boundary value problems; first order linear and quasilinear equations, method of characteristics; wave and heat equations on the line, half-line, and in space; separation of variables for heat and wave equations on an interval and for Laplace\u2019s equation on rectangles and discs; eigenfunctions of the Laplacian and heat, wave, Poisson\u2019s equations on bounded domains; and Green\u2019s functions and distributions. Prerequisites: MATH 140B or MATH 142B. Students who have not completed listed prerequisite(s) may enroll with the consent of instructor.",
