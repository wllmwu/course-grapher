Explore how constitutions work: as interpretive instruments designed to frame, organize, guide human thought, action, and systems (according to certain rules or principles often represented as divine in origin and universal in effect) and; as ongoing, dynamic interpretative processes that nevertheless congeal in objects, bodies, and social arrangements and are thus considered binding or unalterable.
