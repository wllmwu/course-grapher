  "description": "This course covers mathematical models of neurons, synapses, and neural networks. We will introduce theoretical frameworks of brain activity and function to understand neural computation and control of behavior. We will discuss network dynamics, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Students will apply modeling approaches to address scientific questions and make predictions for experiments. Enrollment restricted to students only in the following major codes: BI77, BI78, BI80, BI81, BI82, BI83, BI84, BI85, BI86, BI87."
