  "description": "This course presents a self-contained treatment of kinetics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, with an emphasis on astrophysical applications. Topics include the Boltzmann and Vlasov equations, transport, hydrodynamic equations, radiation transport, stochastic dynamics, Fokker-Planck theory, and phase transition dynamics. Emphasis throughout is on physical motivation and relevant applications. Renumbered from PHYA 231. Students may not receive credit for both ASTR 222 and PHYA 231."
