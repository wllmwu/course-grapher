  "description": "This course examines the interaction between sections of the globe after 1200. It emphasizes factors operating on a transcontinental scale (disease, climate, migration) and historical/cultural phenomena that bridge distance (religion, trade, urban systems). This is not narrative history, but a study of developments that operated on a global scale and constituted the first phase of globalization.\u00a0+"
