In this course, we will learn how to determine whether arguments that can be represented in first order predicate logic are deductively valid, how to symbolize English arguments, the rules of a natural deduction system, how to apply those rules to determine the logical status of symbolized arguments, and how to use semantic methods for determining validity and invalidity.
