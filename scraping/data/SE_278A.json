  "description": "Development and application of advanced computational techniques for fluid flow. Stabilized and variational multiscale methods for finite element and related discretizations are stressed. Applications involve advection-diffusion equations and systems, and incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Turbulence modeling will also be covered. Prerequisites: MAE 232A or SE 276A or consent of instructor, graduate standing.",
