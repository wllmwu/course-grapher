  "description": "This course covers topics in space geodesy related to the recovery and interpretation of crustal deformation measured by the Global Positioning System (GPS) as well as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). The topics rotate yearly depending on the needs of the mostly geophysics graduate students. The course involves weekly meetings and discussions of papers. Students are also encouraged to participate in optional field trips to perform geodetic surveys. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor. (S/U grades only)"
