  "description": "This course will survey questions surrounding the \u201ccoevolution\u201d of human and technics and ways such processes are making new worlds of which we often feel a sense of perpetual disruption. We investigate posthuman not only in terms of new technological practices but spiritual experiences that bring about new understandings of being human in the world. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
