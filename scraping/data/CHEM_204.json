  "description": "(Conjoined with CHEM 104.) Analysis of macromolecular structures by X-ray diffraction. Topics include symmetry, geometry of diffraction, detection of diffraction, intensity of diffracted waves, phase problem and its solution, heavy atom method, isomorphous replacement, anomalous dispersion phasing methods (MAD), direct methods, and molecular replacement. CHEM 204 students will be required to complete additional paper and/or exam beyond that expected of students in CHEM 104."
