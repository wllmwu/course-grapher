  "description": "This class covers the key drivers for making data-driven pricing decisions. Price setting is one of the most crucial of all tactical marketing decisions. It involves a detailed understanding of both supply-side (e.g., costs) and demand-side factors (e.g., consumer willingness to pay). In this course, we will approach the pricing decision as an intersection of economic, strategic, and behavioral considerations. Prerequisites: restricted to MS in business analytics program or with department and instructor approval."
