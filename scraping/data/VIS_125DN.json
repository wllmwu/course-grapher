  "description": "A critical examination of the work of one of the most radical twentieth-century artists. In Duchamp\u2019s four-dimensional perspective, the ideas of art-object, artist, and art itself are deconstructed. The Large Glass and Etant Donn\u00e9es are the twin foci of an oeuvre without boundaries in which many twentieth-century avant-garde devices such as chance techniques, conceptual art, and the fashioning of fictive identities, are invented. Prerequisites: none."
