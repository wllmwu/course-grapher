  "description": "The Cold War is often understood as a superpower rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Yet, the second half of the twentieth century witnessed civil wars, revolutions, decolonization movements, and state violence throughout the world that do not fit in this bipolar framework. Focusing on these other events, this course reexamines the Cold War in global and comparative perspective, with a particular focus on political developments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."
