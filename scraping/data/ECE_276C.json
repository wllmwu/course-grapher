  "description": "This course follows ECE 276A-B, and covers techniques relevant to robot manipulation as well as open problems that involve new forms of machine learning (i.e., reinforcement learning). Topics will review kinematics, dynamics, low-level control and motion planning, and reinforcement learning approaches. A substantial, student-driven project demonstrates their collected knowledge of robotics from ECE 276A-B-C. Prerequisites: ECE 276B; graduate standing.",
