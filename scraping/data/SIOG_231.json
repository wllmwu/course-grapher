  "description": "Observations of Earth\u2019s internal and external magnetic fields are used to study the core geodynamo and to image the electrical conductivity structure of the crust and mantle. This course will cover the theory of geomagnetism and electromagnetic induction, instrumentation, forward and inverse modeling of geomagnetic and electromagnetic data, properties of Earth materials, and applications. Renumbered from SIO 231. Students will not receive credit for both SIOG 231 and SIO 231. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor. (S/U grades permitted.)"
