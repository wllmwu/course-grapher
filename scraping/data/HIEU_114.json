  "description": "The Bolshevik revolution was supposed to change humanity. Led by Vladimir Lenin and perverted by Joseph Stalin, the USSR defeated Nazism in World War II and challenged the U.S. throughout the Cold War. It then collapsed, transitioning from a chaotic version of democracy and market economy to authoritarianism and controlled capitalism."
