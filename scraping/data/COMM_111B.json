  "description": "Across the globe, geopolitical borders are charged sites of cross-cultural communication and conflict. While borders are commonly conceived as fixed physical demarcations, in this course we will examine borders as sites of exchange, as contested boundaries where diverse actors and practices converge and diverge, and as complex historical and socio-spatial formations that call into question presumed divisions between inside/outside, us/them, human/nonhuman, and technological/ecological.
