  "description": "Molecular and cellular approaches to the study of the nervous system are advancing neurobiology at an increasingly rapid pace. This graduate-level course will address the latest molecular advances in the areas of: 1) synapse formation, neurotransmitter release, and neurotransmitter receptors; 2) nerve growth factors, their receptors, and neuronal apoptosis; 3) transcriptional regulation in the brain and peripheral nervous system; 4) cell culture, transgenic, and knock-out mouse model systems; 5) the molecular bases of genetic, psychiatric, and degenerative diseases of the nervous system; and 6) the current molecular knowledge of vision, sensory transduction, circadian rhythms, learning, memory, and behavior."
