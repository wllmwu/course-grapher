  "description": "Research rotations provide the opportunity for first-year PhD students to obtain research experience in data analysis under the guidance of HDSI affiliated faculty members. Through the rotations, students can identify a faculty member under whose supervision their dissertation research will be completed. Each research rotation is quarter-long; working with a HDSI faculty member and students are required to complete three separate rotations. Each student is required to take the course three times with at least two different instructors. Prerequisites: none. Only first-year PhD students are eligible."
