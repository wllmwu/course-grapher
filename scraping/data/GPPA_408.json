  "description": "The course examines the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis through the lens of public and private sector participants with an interest in exploring the real-world challenges of practical governance, the threat of \u201ctoo-big-to-fail,\u201d limits on authorities, and questions about who should be included in the circle of government protection in a crisis. Through speeches, writings, and testimony of key actors, we will develop a framework for evaluating other financial crises, such as those in the 1990s. Students may not earn credit for GPPA 408 and GPGN 490 with the same title."
