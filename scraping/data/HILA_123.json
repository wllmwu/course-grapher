  "description": "The Incas called their realm Tahuantinsuyu (Land of the Four Quarters). But the Incas were only one of the many ethnic groups in the Andean region. Many different other groups became a part of the Tahuantinsuyu in the wake of Inca expansion. Over the past decade, new and fascinating information on these processes have been published and allow for a rereading of Inca history between 900 and 1535. +"
