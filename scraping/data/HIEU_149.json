  "description": "History of Spain from the arrival of Islam in 711 CE to the Christian conquest of Granada in 1492. The term \u201cmedieval Spain\u201d evokes popular stereotypes, including that of a dark period of Islamic \u201coccupation\u201d of Christian territory, and its counterpart, tolerant society of Jews, Muslims, and Christians that might serve as a model for today\u2019s world. Students will study the complexity of life in medieval Spain, discerning nuances more interesting and surprising than either of these stereotypes. +"
