Thereafter, pairs of students will take turns replicating and extending a working paper by an established political scientist\u2014normally a visitor to UC San Diego\u2014and will present their findings in front of the author. Through such reverse engineering, students will learn how to do excellent quantitative work. Prerequisites: POLI 204B and POLI 270 and POLI 271; graduate standing.",
