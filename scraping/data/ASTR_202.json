  "description": "This is a foundational course in fluid dynamics at a graduate level which is aimed at students primarily interested in astrophysical applications. Topics include the dynamics of ideal fluids, vorticity, stability, boundary layers, turbulence, compressible flows, shocks, and self-gravitating flows. Case studies will be drawn from astrophysical phenomena, including stellar accretion, solar wind, turbulence in molecular clouds, supernovae shocks, self-gravitating disks, and others. Renumbered from PHYA 202. Students may not receive credit for both ASTR 202 and PHYA 202."
