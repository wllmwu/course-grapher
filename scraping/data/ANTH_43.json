  "description": "This course examines conceptions of race from evolutionary and sociocultural perspectives. We will critically examine how patterns of current human genetic variation map onto conceptions of race. We will also focus on the history of the race concept and explore ways in which biomedical researchers and physicians use racial categories today. Finally, we will examine the social construction of race, and the experiences and consequences of racism on health in the United States and internationally."
