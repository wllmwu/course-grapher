  "description": "This course emphasizes the chemical principles that control basic aqueous chemistry in marine systems. The focus will be to show that the geochemistry of the various elements in sea water and biological systems can be understood as a consequence of basic general chemical concepts such as electron structure, chemical bonding, and group and periodic properties. Recommended preparation: undergraduate chemistry equivalent to UC San Diego CHEM 6 sequence. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
