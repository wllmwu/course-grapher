  "description": "Human-centered design involves iteratively creating and testing public health interventions (e.g., behavioral, environmental, policy) that balance trade-offs (e.g., benefits people, works in the \u201creal-world,\u201d minimizes negative effects). Students will work with community partners on real-world problems and learn both principles and concrete skills. By class completion, students should be adept at using human-centered design methods in the formative creation of public health interventions. Prerequisites: must be enrolled in MPH program (FM75) or program approval."
