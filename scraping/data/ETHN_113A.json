  "description": "The origins, development, and practice of the geological sciences are closely tied to colonization, but these ties rarely are acknowledged, discussed, critiqued, or used as a basis for rethinking present-day practices and trends. We will deconstruct the historical relationship between colonialism and geology, discuss how this relationship has developed over time, and explore practical methods for how the field of geology (and, by extension, other fields of Western science) might be decolonized."
