  "description": "Operating a business is a complex task but a skill that can be mastered. Business managers make interconnected decisions to bring products and services to market. How many workers should a burrito chain employ given demand projections and which burrito-building tasks should be completed before a customer walks in? When a bakery makes pastries, how many at a time? Why do airlines overbook? Managers must answer these questions to keep operations lean and outdo competitors. Students will not receive credit for both MGT 71R and MGT 71. This course is a distance education course.",
