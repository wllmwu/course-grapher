  "description": "(Cross-listed with TDGE 131.) This course examines recent movies by Native American/First Nations artists that labor to deconstruct and critique reductive stereotypes about America\u2019s First Peoples in Hollywood cinema. Carving spaces of \u201cvisual sovereignty\u201d (Raheja), these films propose complex narratives and characterizations of indigeneity. Students may not receive credit for TDGE 131, TDGE 131R, ETHN 163FR, and ETHN 163F."
