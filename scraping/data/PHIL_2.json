  "description": "An exploration of paradoxes on a wide range of philosophical topics, including time, logic, science, belief, decision, and value. Paradoxes serve as a stepping stone to deeper philosophical questions, such as: Is time real? What is a person? Does language shape reality? Is infinity coherent? Can we know anything? How do we learn from experience? Are our experiences real? What is it to be rational? Should we believe in God? Can morality be rationalized? And finally, why is death bad?"
