  "description": "Course explores how public policy is made by California\u2019s statewide institutions, including the legislature, governor, executive branch agencies and the courts, and the myriad of local governments: special districts, cities, and counties. We look at political history, and how direct democracy has affected different constituencies. The second half of the course looks at policymaking by the executive branch and state agencies, the courts, and local governments, specifically in terms of budgeting. Students may not earn credit for GPPA 401 and GPGN 490 of the same title."
