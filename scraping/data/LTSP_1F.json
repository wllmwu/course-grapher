  "description": "This course is for students who have a cultural connection to Spanish having been exposed to Spanish at home, from relatives, or in the community. In this class we do not assume students have speaking ability Spanish, but understand some Spanish passively. The course builds on the skills students already have in order to expand their written and oral proficiency in a confidence-building environment. Students also explore their cultural heritage and learn about Hispanic cultures in the U.S.  Prerequisites:  consent of instructor (through placement exam). Students will need to confirm their heritage learner status through placement exam and consultation with our department faculty.",
