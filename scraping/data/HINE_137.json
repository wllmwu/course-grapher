  "description": "A historical background to deepen an understanding of contemporary conflicts in the Middle East. The course surveys the history of Jewish and Palestinian peoples from 1881\u2013present; contrasts the deep structures of the two societies; surveys political ideologies, charismatic leaders, and social movements; and evaluates the consequences of the British Mandate. At 1948 we juxtapose the new Jewish sovereignty with the movement of Palestinian Arabs away from the borders of the new state."
