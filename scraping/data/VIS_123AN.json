  "description": "The art of the Early Renaissance in Northern Europe is marked by what appears to be striking conflict: on the one hand, a new love of nature and the pleasures of court society, and on the other, an intensified spirituality and focus on personal devotion. This course explores these provocative crosscurrents in works by master painters like Jan van Eyck and Hieronymus Bosch as well as in lesser known mass-produced objects of everyday use. Prerequisites: none."
