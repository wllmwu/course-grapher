  "description": "Medicine in the United States is sustained by inequities in racial, sexual, and dis/ability knowledge and practice. Health practitioners, patients, and scholars have argued for an antiracist medical education that explores power dynamics, stereotypes, and violence in medicine. This course utilizes an antiracist lens to examine medical knowledge and practice. Additionally, the course draws from the theoretical and narrative perspectives about health from artists, scholars, and activists."
