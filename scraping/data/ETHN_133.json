  "description": "(Cross-listed with TDHT 111.) This course examines performances from Latinx America that address issues of immigration, sexual politics, and gender, racial, and economic inequality among other topics. Students learn about how artists and communities use performance to explore a wealth of cultural practices and identities that have emerged alongside\u2014and often in response to\u2014the historical conditions that shape the disparate yet interconnected experiences of Latinx people living in the U.S. (colonialism, slavery, imperialism)."
