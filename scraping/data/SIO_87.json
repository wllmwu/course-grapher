First-year seminars can be offered in all campus departments and undergraduate colleges, and topics vary from quarter to quarter. Enrollment is limited to fifteen to twenty students, with preference given to entering first-year students. Students may complete up to four first-year seminars with the stipulation that none of the seminars are repeated. (P/NP grades only)."
