  "description": "Rock magnetism and acquisition of magnetic remanence in geological materials as well as laboratory procedures and data analysis (isolating remanence components and statistical approaches). The paleomagnetic literature will be used to illustrate applications in geological and geophysical problems. Recommended preparation: one year each of college-level physics and geology; mathematics through calculus. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor. (S/U grades permitted.)"
