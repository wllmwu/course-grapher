  "description": "Mitigating the effects of conflict and inequality is a major priority for global health practitioners. This course explores the ways that conflict and structural inequalities deeply affect people\u2019s mental and physical health and how they cope and survive in these conditions. We know that the effects of violence and war do not just disappear after the fact but linger for a long time. How do we know how and when a person\u2019s health is restored after massive disruptions? Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
