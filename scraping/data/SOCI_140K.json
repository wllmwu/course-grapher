  "description": "This course offers an overview of the courts of China. The focus is not on blackletter law. Instead, we look at what grassroots courts do on a daily basis. China has arguably the largest court system in the world. What does it do? How are the courts organized internally? What is the relationship between the courts and other government bureaucracies? Is there the rule of law in China? The course will address these questions by reviewing latest empirical research on the subject area. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
