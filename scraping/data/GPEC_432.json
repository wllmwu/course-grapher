  "description": "The goals of the course are to help students acquire analytic skills used in the study of labor economics and international migration. We examine the causes of immigration, the consequences of immigration for wages and employment in sending and receiving countries, and policies governing high-skilled immigration, undocumented immigration, and refugees. Students produce an original project that demonstrates their master of quantitative tools used in economics. Renumbered from IRGN 432. Students may not receive credit for GPEC 432 and IRGN 432."
