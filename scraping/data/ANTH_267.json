  "description": "Despite being foundational to the discipline of anthropology, ethnographic methods are often mystifying to graduate students. Students are expected to simply go into their respective field sites armed with a notebook, voice recorder, and hope. Drawing on feminist and decolonial epistemologies, we will examine, critique, and reconstruct ethnography\u2019s dilemmas, changing forms, and ethical stakes as we understand it as a particular mode of writing and representation. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
