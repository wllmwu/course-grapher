We will discuss how immigration, class, and norms of ethnicity, race, and gender determine the construction, expression, and reframing of Latinx sexualities. Students will not receive credit for both CGS 115 and 187. Prerequisites: CGS 2A-B, ETHN 1, 2, 3, at least one CGS or ETHN upper-division course, or permission of the instructor.",
