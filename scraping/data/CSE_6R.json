  "description": "An introduction to computer science and programming using the Python language. The course will cover topics such as basic data types (e.g., integer, float, string), loops and iteration, basic data structures (e.g., list, set, dictionary), memory models, conditional statements, recursion, basic algorithm time complexity analysis, class design, and inheritance. A student may not receive credit for CSE 6R after receiving credit for CSE 8A, CSE 8B, CSE 11, or COGS 18. Students may receive credit for only one of the following: COGS 18, CSE 8A, or CSE 6R. Recommended preparation: a familiarity with high school-level algebra is expected, but this course assumes no prior programming knowledge or experience.",
