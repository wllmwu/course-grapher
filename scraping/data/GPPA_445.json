  "description": "Ethnicity has emerged in recent decades as an important variable in political economy. This class will explore traditional research areas on ethnic identity and politics, including intergroup contact, ethnic favoritism, and issues of prejudice and discrimination. We will also study new areas of scholarship, such as the political implications of multiple identities and the impact of ethnic diversity on various economic and political outcomes."
