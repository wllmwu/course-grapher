  "description": "This course analyzes the origins of refugee flows, government policies, the role of nongovernmental organizations, and refugee experiences. It explores the debates about who is a refugee, how refugees decide when and where to move, the centrality of violence and persecution, and the place of refugees within the broader category of forced migration. The theoretical discussion engages concrete examples drawn from around the world in countries of origin, asylum, resettlement, and return. Prerequisites: graduate standing in sociology."
