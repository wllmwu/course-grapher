  "description": "Currently 90 percent of genome studies and 95 percent of clinical trials exclusively feature individuals of European ancestry. This bias and systematic lack of engagement of Indigenous people in both clinical trials and genome studies is partially the result of a history of distrust. Through our field school, we will train the next generation of global health professionals to imagine, promote, and sustain a future where Indigenous people are partners in and not subjects of genetic research.
