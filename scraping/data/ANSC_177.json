  "units": "4",
  "dept": "ANTH",
  "anchor": "ansc177",
  "description": "Course aims to explore the ways in which historicity can be turned to a critical field of inquiry and reflection. Shows how the past isn\u2019t something that \u201chas happened,\u201d but that actively lingers\u00a0and invades the present, both inviting and constraining possible futures. Challenges the assumptions and practices of each modern discipline, affecting key concepts, methods, modes of analysis, and narrative forms that both anthropologists and historians have used. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
