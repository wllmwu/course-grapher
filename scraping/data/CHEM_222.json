  "description": "(Cross-listed with MATS 227, NANO 227, and MAE 251.) Key concepts in the atomic structure and bonding of solids such as metals, ceramics, and semiconductors. Symmetry operations, point groups, lattice types, space groups, simple and complex inorganic compounds, structure/property comparisons, structure determination with X-ray diffraction. Ionic, covalent, metallic bonding compared with physical properties. Atomic and molecular orbitals, bands verses bonds, free electron theory. Students may only receive credit for one of the following: CHEM 222, MAE 251, MATS 227, or NANO 227."
