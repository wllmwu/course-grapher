  "description": "Satellite remote sensing provides global observations of Earth to monitor environmental changes in land, oceans, and ice. Overview, physical principles of remote sensing, including orbits, electromagnetic radiation, diffraction, electro-optical, and microwave systems. Weekly labs explore remote sensing data sets. Graduate students will also be required to write a term paper and do an oral presentation. Prerequisites: undergraduate: PHYS 2A-B or PHYS 4A-B-C, or consent of instructor. Graduate: graduate-level standing or consent of instructor.",
