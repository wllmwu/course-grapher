  "description": "Explores the intersections of blackness, Chicanidad, and Latinidad in relation to each other, focusing on how these identities project, intersect, conflict, and complement each other. Combining cultural and historical analyses, we dissect these rallying banners through the lenses of race, gender, class, nation, pan-ethnicity, diaspora, colonialism, imperialism, citizenship, movement, and solidarity."
