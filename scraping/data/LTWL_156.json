  "description": "This course examines the presence of diasporic Asians in the U.S. through film and visual media. The Asian diasporic figures we examine will include the immigrant, the exile, the refugee, the transnational adoptee, the Internet bride, the queer subject, and the restauranteur. How does diaspora challenge and reinforce national identity? How does it interrogate notions of ethnic, racial, and cultural authenticity? In what ways does diaspora trouble the idea of an original homeland?"
