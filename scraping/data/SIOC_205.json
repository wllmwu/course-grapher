  "description": "The course focuses on estuarine and coastal physical dynamics and biogeochemical/ecosystem impacts. Topics are adjusted for student interest, but include turbulence and the bottom boundary layer, tides (origin and propagation), estuary types, tidally averaged dynamics, temporal variation, stratification, lateral processes and fronts, dispersion mechanisms, sediment transport, estuarine productivity (nutrients, oxygen, and eutrophication), estuarine ecosystems, river plumes, and coastal upwelling. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
