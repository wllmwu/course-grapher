  "description": "This course allows students to use what they learned in introductory programming courses to make things happen in the real world. Working in teams, students will first learn to program Arduino-based devices. Teams of students will design a custom device and program it to do their bidding. This course is targeted to first-year students and sophomores in engineering and science disciplines who want to practice applying what they have learned in a programming class and to have the chance to program things other than computers. Program or materials fees may apply. Prerequisites: restricted to first-year and sophomore students; instructor approval required."
