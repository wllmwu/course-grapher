  "description": "This course puts the perennial hot-button topic of the border into historical and anthropological perspective, unpacking its importance for both Mexico and the United States. After establishing its implications since 1848 for national identities, flows of labor and capital, and state consolidation, we will explore a series of contemporary topics including tourism and cross-border consumption, violence and illegal traffic, border enforcement technologies, migration and asylum, and more. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
