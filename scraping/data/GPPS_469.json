  "description": "This course surveys theoretical explanations for why states choose the strategies they do and how they implement their diplomatic and military policies in order to carry out those strategies. Different explanatory factors are found in the international system, domestic politics, and the political-economy of military power, and they can interact in surprising ways. These general theories are examined through comparative analysis of the great World War II powers and the contemporary strategic debate. Renumbered from IRGN 469. Students may not receive credit for GPPS 469 and IRGN 469."
