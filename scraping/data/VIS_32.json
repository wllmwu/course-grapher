  "description": "Neuroscience is a fast-growing biology field, with projects such as the White House BRAIN Initiative and the Allen Brain Atlas and new areas such as neuroeconomics, neurophilosophy, and neuroaesthetics. This lecture course considers interactions between neuroscience and art, primarily focusing on studies of how art is represented in the brain. By considering perception, emotion, memory, and creativity, we approach scientific understandings of art and design. Prerequisites: none."
