  "description": "This course takes a decision-making orientation to negotiation. The course will build cumulatively from (seemingly) simple negotiations to those of greater complexity. These structured negotiation exercises are used to isolate and emphasize specific analytic points and essential skills. Cases and readings should help the student to integrate the analysis as well as to develop intuition about more complex negotiations. Students will not receive credit for both MGT 162 and MGT 162R. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
