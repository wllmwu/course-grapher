  "description": "This course explores intersections between religious discourse and ecological discourse by considering texts from both that treat the human world as irreducibly interconnected with more-than-human worlds of nature and \u201cspirit.\u201d Themes include the ambivalence of wildness; the critique of anthropocentrism (human-centeredness); and the question of how religious emphasis on \u201cknowing (one\u2019s) place\u201d can create a sense of either human exceptionality, above nature, or embeddedness, within nature. Prerequisites: upper-division standing or consent of instructor."
