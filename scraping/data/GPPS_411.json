  "description": "What role do interest groups play in policy-making processes? What role should they play? How have political systems tried to regulate the role of special interests? Has it worked? This course is an introduction to these questions, primarily focusing on the US context. We will look at lobbying, the revolving door, regulatory capture, campaign finance. We will engage with this topic from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, wherever possible highlighting cutting-edge empirical research."
