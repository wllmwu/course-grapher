  "description": "This course explores the diverse ways that anthropologists and other scholars have developed \u201cvalue\u201d as a concept and category for defining their object of study. From price to ethic to meaning, and more, the term\u2019s attractiveness seems to lie in its flexibility and inclusivity. These varied approaches to value each carry significant ontological, epistemological, and political implications, which we will critically examine. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
