  "description": "This course explores how genetic data can be used to address core issues in human evolution. We will reconstruct population history and explore sources of human genetic diversity, such as migration and selection, based on studies of modern and ancient DNA. Through critical evaluation of recent publications, we will discuss the molecular evidence for the origin of modern humans, race, reconstruction of key human migrations, interactions with the environment, and implications for disease. May be coscheduled with ANBI 134. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
