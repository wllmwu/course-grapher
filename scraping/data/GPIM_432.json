  "description": "This course examines the tensions between technology and globalization on the one hand and national identity on the other. We discuss the creation of liberal post-war trade, monetary, and policy regimes and how technological change influenced these developments. We then examine the evolution of policy toward the internet, mobile telephony, and associated ICT products and services. We will also study current challenges in trade, investment, censorship, privacy and content regulation. Students may not earn credit for GPIM 432 and GPGN 490 with the same title."
