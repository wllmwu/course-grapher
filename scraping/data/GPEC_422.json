  "description": "This course is devoted to studying the central player in the globalization process: the multinational corporation. From the perspective of both developed and developing countries, we will analyze the determinants of flows of multinational firms and foreign direct investment across countries; explore the incentives a firm has to become an MNC, particularly those to split production, and its consequences on a domestic economy; and the transfer of managerial abilities across countries. May not receive credit for GPEC 422 and IRGN 490. Knowledge of STATA is assumed."
