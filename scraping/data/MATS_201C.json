  "description": "Classification of phase transformations: displacive and reconstructive transformations: classical and nonclassical theories of nucleation: Becker-Doering, Volmer-Weber, lattice instabilities, spinodal decomposition. Growth theories: interface migration, stress effects, terrace-ledge mechanisms, epitaxial growth, kinetics, and mechanics. Precipitation. Order-disorder transformations. Solidification. Amorphization. Prerequisites: consent of instructor. (Cross-listed with MAE 271C.)"
