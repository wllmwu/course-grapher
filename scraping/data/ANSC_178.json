  "description": "Students will learn firsthand a new transdisciplinary effort to understand the intersection of individual and society at all levels of analysis. This course introduces students to a remarkable convergence led by transdisciplinary scholars at UC San Diego (anthropology, cognitive science, psychology, history, philosophy, the arts, etc.), based on the recognition that individual neurological, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral capacities are reciprocally related to aggregate social, cultural, and historical processes. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
