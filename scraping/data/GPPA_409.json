  "description": "Governments use the tools of diplomacy as they negotiate the framework of rules and disciplines within which markets and trade operate and as they promote opportunities for domestic companies abroad. This course will use case studies to illuminate the various objectives of government actors engaging in economic diplomacy and the impact their decisions can have on the conduct of business, considering how diplomacy promotes trade, stability, security, and levels the playing field for companies."
