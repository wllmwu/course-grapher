  "description": "This course provides an introduction to the Tijuana-San Diego border, seeing it as a microcosm of global conflict from where to engage urban inequality and explore new approaches to democratize the city. The course zooms into the border flows that make the marginalized neighborhoods within this contested geography into sites of social-economic and cultural productivity, laboratories in which to rethink the gap between wealth and poverty. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
