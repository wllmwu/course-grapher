  "description": "This course focuses on the social processes shaping the pre-Hispanic societies of the Caribbean Archipelago from 7kya to 1500 CE. Through the lens of material culture, we examine the archaeology of both the Greater and the Lesser Antilles, and recognize the role that colonialism has had on modern Caribbean identities and discourses, including the development of Tainidad as indigeneity in the present. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
