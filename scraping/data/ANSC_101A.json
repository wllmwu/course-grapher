  "description": "This course examines Korean Wave media (e.g., music, dramas, film) as an institution of transnational cultural change in relation to everyday social behavior, consumerism, and identifications with gender, sexuality, class, race, and nationality. The course highlights different responses to Korean media to analyze how cultural meanings are not fixed by the productive frame of Korean society and its \u201ccultural industries,\u201d but rather interpreted, reimagined, and performed by international audiences. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
