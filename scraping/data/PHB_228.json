  "description": "The goal of this course is to give students a useful toolkit for handling statistical computations in R. This includes being able to write legible and robust code, debug R functions, run computer simulations, find ways to speed up calculations, encapsulate code and documents in R packages, and have some sense of issues that impact real-world computation. Students may not receive credit for PHB 228 and the FMPH 291 taught with the same title. Prerequisites: FMPH 221 or PHB 221, and FMPH 222 or PHB 222, and FMPH 244B or MATH 281A or PHB 244B. Restricted to biostatistics majors or department approval.",
