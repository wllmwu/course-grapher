  "description": "This course provides a rigorous treatment of hypothesis testing, statistical inference, model fitting, and exploratory data analysis techniques used in the cognitive and neural sciences. Students will acquire an understanding of mathematical foundations and hands-on experience in applying these methods using MATLAB. Cognitive science PhD students must enroll for four units and will be required to do assignments and a final project. All other students can enroll for two units and will be required to complete all assignments but not a final project (or by request a project and no assignments)."
