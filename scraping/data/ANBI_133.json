The course examines the natural history, behavior, ecology, and life history of each of the great apes including orangutans, gorillas, bonobos, and chimpanzees. We will also consider conservation issues facing wild great apes, the welfare of apes in captivity, and ethical debates on ape \u201cpersonhood.\u201d Prerequisites:\u00a0upper-division standing."
