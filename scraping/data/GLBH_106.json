  "description": "This course provides an overview of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) in global health. We discuss the global burden of disease from inadequate access to WaSH services, survey the state of WaSH across the globe, learn about a range of WaSH technologies, examine the social, economic, and policy considerations important in WaSH planning and sustainability, and learn how to conduct a water safety test. Case studies from the Americas, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa will be discussed. It is recommended that students take GLBH 20, Introduction to Global Health, prior to enrolling in this course."
