  "description": "This course will address theories and practices for achieving schools and classrooms that are informed by and built around the participation of diverse communities and cultures. The emphasis is on how leadership intersects with sociohistorical and sociocultural theories that suggest that the organization of schools and instruction is critical to student inclusion and outcomes. A basic premise of this course is that a socially just learning theory begins with using all of the resources and knowledge of families, communities, and cultures in formulating policy and practice. Prerequisites: Joint EdD in Educational Leadership student status."
