  "description": "This course examines conceptions of race from both evolutionary and sociocultural perspectives. We will examine current patterns of human genetic variation and critically determine how these patterns map onto current and historic conceptions of race in the United States, and abroad. We will also explore the social construction of race throughout US history, the use of racial categories in biomedicine today, and consequences of racism and discrimination on health.
