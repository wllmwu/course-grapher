  "description": "This course is a survey of the history of India and South Asia since c. 1750. It provides the historical depth to understand contemporary South Asia through a historical inquiry into the making and multiple meanings of modernity. It explores the history, culture, and political economy of the subcontinent, which provides a fascinating laboratory to study such themes as colonialism, nationalism, partition, the modern state, economic development, religious identities, and center-region problems."
