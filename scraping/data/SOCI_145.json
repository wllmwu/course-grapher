  "description": "Focusing on American history, this course explores violence in the light of three major themes: struggles over citizenship and nationhood; the drawing and maintenance of racial, ethnic, and gender boundaries; and the persistence of notions of \u201cmasculinity\u201d and its relation to violence. Prerequisites: upper-division standing. Will not receive credit for SOCI 145 and SOCB 145."
