  "description": "Exploration of astronomical transient phenomena: short-lived explosive events associated with the deaths of stars or destruction of stellar remnants. Observational signatures of transients in photons, gravitational waves, and neutrinos; stars, neutron stars, and black holes in their progenitor systems; and physics involved in the explosions. Transients covered may include supernovae, kilonovae, gamma-ray bursts, tidal disruption events, fast radio bursts, fast blue optical transients, or AGN. Prerequisites: PHYS 2A/2AR-B-C-D or 4A-B-C-D-E.",
