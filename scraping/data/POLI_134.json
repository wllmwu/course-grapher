  "description": "Political parties are fundamental to almost every democratic regime, and many authoritarian ones too. This class examines their role in developing countries. Where do parties come from? What part do they play in nationalist liberation struggles? How do they win support? Do extremist parties stoke ethnic violence? Can stable party systems boost economic growth? The class canvasses key political science theories and draws on both quantitative and case-study evidence from across the Global South."
