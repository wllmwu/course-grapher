  "description": "This course examines concrete historical attempts to build more free and equal societies and institutions. From the Paris commune to Black Lives Matter, we will study the challenges and consequences of real efforts to break down power, distribute economic resources fairly, and provide everyone with the opportunity to flourish as individuals. By analyzing these efforts through a sociological lens, the course provides a framework for thinking critically and empirically about social justice. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
