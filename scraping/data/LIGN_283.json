  "description": "(Same as PSYC 260.) This class will investigate case studies in conceptual development that interact with language acquisition, including domains such as time, space, number, and theory of mind. The approach of the class will be to explore the chosen case study from the perspective of philosophy, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and comparative psychology, with a particular focus on how conceptual development is affected by the acquisition of language."
