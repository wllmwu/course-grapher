  "description": "Education is often thought of as \u201cthe great equalizer\u201d but in the U.S. and around the world, many governments fail to ensure that all citizens have access to high-quality educational opportunities. Why? This course will give students the conceptual tools to understand who shapes education policy decisions, through what channels, and how those policy decisions affect the quality and equity of education. Emphasis is on the U.S., but analyzed in comparative perspective. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
