  "description": "Questions of morality are implicit in all aspects of health. Drawing insights from the medical humanities, this course engages students in thinking about the human condition (what it means to be human or dehumanized) from multiple perspectives: individual, social, civic. How do humans ascribe meaning to their lives? What does it take to flourish? What is empathy; for whom do we have it? What is ethical and just about the organization of society and its impact on health?"
