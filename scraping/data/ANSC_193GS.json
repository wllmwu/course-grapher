  "description": "In this course, we will examine the dominant human rights framework to think about one issue that has escaped its purview: environmental justice. If we all share a common planet, is there a universal right to a clean environment? Why are the effects of pollution and climate change unequally distributed among the world\u2019s peoples? Can human rights norms serve as effective tools to fight the unequal effects of climate change and contamination? Program or materials fees may apply. Prerequisites: department approval required and upper-division standing. Students must apply for and be accepted to the Global Seminar program."
