  "description": "This course studies movement practices from social dancing to political protest, including embodiments framed explicitly as dance as well as those not readily legible as such. How is moving a form of citizenry, refusal, community-building, art-making, remembrance, and communal forgetting? Framed as knowledge-making systems, students will attend to how dance and movement varyingly articulate belonging, joy, and discipline in relation to histories of race, gender, sexuality, ability, class, and nation. Prerequisites: none."
