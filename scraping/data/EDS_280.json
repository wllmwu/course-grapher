  "description": "This course will present the evolution of leadership thought and theory, with an emphasis on the distinction between, and interrelatedness of, effective management and leadership. The ethics of leadership practice and epistemological perspectives of emerging leadership styles will be explored, and students will have opportunities to reflect on the nature of leadership as it is practiced in educational settings. Applying critical, self-reflective leadership practice through structured activities is also an element of this course."
