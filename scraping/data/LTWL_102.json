  "description": "Who were the people of Mesopotamia? What was life like in ancient Sumer and Babylon? How did they view themselves and the world around them? To answer these questions, this course will take a rapid tour covering about 4,000 years. To break up our historical tour de force we will often pause to look at themes that make Mesopotamian civilization so interesting. This includes mythology, language and literature, magic, medicine, the afterlife, and the legacy of ancient Mesopotamia today."
