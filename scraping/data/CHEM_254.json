  "description": "A qualitative approach to the mechanisms of various organic reactions; substitutions, additions, eliminations, condensations, rearrangements, oxidations, reductions, free-radical reactions, and photochemistry. Includes considerations of molecular structure and reactivity, synthetic methods, spectroscopic tools, and stereochemistry. Topics will vary year to year. This is the second quarter of the advanced organic chemistry sequence. May be coscheduled with CHEM 154. Prerequisites: graduate standing. CHEM 252 is strongly recommended."
