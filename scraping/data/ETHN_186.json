  "description": "This course examines race and sexuality as performance. Performance studies analyze how social forms like gender, race, sexuality, nationality, belief, and ability are constructed, normalized, and reimagined. Through art and writing by queer people of color, we examine how culture is enacted not just in formal venues like theatres, but in public spaces through institutions like the court, in film and literature, and in one\u2019s relationships and communities."
