  "description": "The rise of radical right-wing, authoritarian populism in democratic societies is one of the most remarkable features of our time. It inevitably awakens the memory of fascism in the 1930s. We will examine their distinct features, such as leadership cult, xenophobia, mockery of facts, disdain for the rule of law, and differences. Our focus will be the connection between the growth of economic inequality and racial animosity and the rise of contemporary populism in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
