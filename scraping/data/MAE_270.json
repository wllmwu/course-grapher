  "description": "Introduction to engineering design optimization involving multidisciplinary models. Topics covered include local sensitivity analysis, gradient-based optimization, gradient-free optimization, surrogate models, discrete optimization, and multidisciplinary design optimization architectures. Students will apply these methods to a practical design problem of their choosing through a course project.\u00a0Prerequisites: graduate standing."
