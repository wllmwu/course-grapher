Topics include trade, lending, investments, the globalization of state-owned enterprises, currency internationalization, participation in regional and international organizations, and China\u2019s economic diplomacy and foreign policy. We will ask whether China contributes to or threatens the liberal economic order; what governments and policy actors can do to engage China in a productive and peaceful fashion.
