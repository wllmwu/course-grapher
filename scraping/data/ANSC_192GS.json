  "description": "Why are so many people poor? What does poverty mean for those who live it and for those who try to help them? This course examines the field of international development, to understand the discourses and practices that governments, aid agencies, and communities have tried. To what extent are these practices linked to colonial legacies, race, and class? Looking to new innovations in participatory and compassionate development, this will prepare students for critical engagement with development. Program or materials fees may apply. Prerequisites: department approval required and upper-division standing. Students must apply for and be accepted to the Global Seminar program."
