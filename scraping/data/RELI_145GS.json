  "description": "This course will look at the relationship between information communication technologies (ICTs) and religion and how they have intersected or diverged in the course of history. We will look at both older and newer media, such as telegraph, radio, television, cassette tapes, Internet and satellite, and how they have been used by groups like evangelical, Catholic, or Islamist movements in proliferation and transformation of ideas, rituals, ideologies, values, and diverse forms of sociability. Program or materials fees may apply. Students may not receive credit for both RELI 145GS and RELI 145. Prerequisites: students must apply and be accepted to the Global Seminars program."
