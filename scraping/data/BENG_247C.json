  "description": "Bionanotechnology is defined as science and engineering that involve working with biomolecules on the nanoscale. DNA and protein-based nanostructures or even entire microorganisms are subject of study and development of nanomachines. Another avenue is the nanoscale biomimicry in which synthetic systems are engineered to mimic what nature has already achieved. Bionanotechnology finds utility in medicine, materials, the environment. Students may receive credit for one of the following: NANO 247C, BENG 247C, or ECE 247C. Prerequisites: graduate standing.
