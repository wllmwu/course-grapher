Dr. Farmer used a strong moral focus on equity and social justice and an anthropologically informed analysis of health to deliver life-saving HIV medications around the world and strengthen national health systems. Through a mix of readings and case study reviews, this course will help students understand how theory, social science research, and medicine can be combined to directly help improve the health of the most vulnerable among us."
