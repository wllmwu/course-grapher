  "description": "The focus of early childhood policy is to understand how the diverse policy contexts in which children are born and raised have dramatic implications for their life trajectories. This course examines how, when, and why government intervenes in children\u2019s lives through family, pre-/school, community, and digital media contexts, in the aim to improve their trajectories.
