  "description": "How do local and global power dynamics shape migration and immigrant inequality? In this course, students learn how capitalism, state and local policies, and climate change shape migration. They also discuss how urban politics, economic contexts, border enforcement, and policing drive (or mitigate) immigrant inequalities. Finally, students look at how immigrants organize and reshape the cities they are in, with a focus on Latinos in Southern California and at the US-Mexico border. Prerequisites: upper-division standing or consent of instructor."
