  "description": "Advances in open-source technology are catalyzing advances in environmental fluid mechanics and oceanography. In this course, we will combine lectures and hands-on experience to transition off-the-shelf technology into undersea sensors. Lectures include ocean sensing techniques, sensor characterization and calibration, pressure tolerance design, sensor deployment approaches. Students working in small groups will design and test using MAE and Scripps Institution of Oceanography facilities."
