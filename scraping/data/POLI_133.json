  "description": "This class introduces core topics in the study of South Asian politics. It uses evidence from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka to shed light on key questions in the study of comparative politics. We examine (a) why these nations\u2019 regime trajectories have diverged; (b) violent civil conflict, as well as nuclear weapons\u2019 contribution to regional stability; and (c) human and economic development, including corruption, caste, gender, poverty alleviation, liberalization, and growth."
