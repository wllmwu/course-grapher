For each two-week block, students will read, present, and discuss current research publications which will be paired with a lecture by a research scientist who will describe the major features of each disorder, hypothesis being explored, and the state of therapeutics. The following session will involve a physician presenting an adult patient with the condition, and students will have the opportunity to ask questions of both the physician and the patient. Priority enrollment given to PhD and MD students. MS and undergraduate enrollment permission to be granted by the instructor."
