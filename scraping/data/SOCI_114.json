  "units": "4",
  "dept": "SOC",
  "anchor": "soci114",
  "description": "Telling jokes is fun, but it is also quintessentially a social act. How we make jokes and who we make jokes with is socially prescribed. We use humor every day in our social interactions to solidify social ties, but also to keep us apart. The course will examine the social dynamics of humor, paying specific attention to dimensions of race, gender, sexuality, disability, and national origin. Different types of humor will be analyzed, as well as the role of social media in altering joke culture. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
