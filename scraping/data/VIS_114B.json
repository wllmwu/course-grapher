  "description": "This seminar focuses on the dynamic and at times contentious relationship between antiquity and the Middle Ages as it played out in various environments\u2014physical, social, cultural, and intellectual\u2014from Rome to Constantinople to Venice, Pisa, and Florence. After considering classic and contemporary formulations of the problem, it turns to in-depth examination of the architecture, images, objects, and techniques at sites in the history of art, where fragments were deployed and displayed. This course fulfills the theory requirement and seminar requirement in the art history program. Recommended preparation: VIS 20 or VIS 112. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
