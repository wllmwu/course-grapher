  "description": "This course will explore the rapidly expanding field of ecological developmental biology which focuses on how factors such as temperature, nutrition, microbes, predators, and hormones influence development epigenetically. Emphasis will be given to the genetic basis of responses to the environment, drawn from studies in aquatic and terrestrial animals and plants. Topics include phenotypic plasticity, teratogenesis, symbiosis, endocrine disruptors, sex determination, and genetic assimilation. Recommended preparation: BICD 100. Prerequisites: BILD 3, or consent of instructor.",
