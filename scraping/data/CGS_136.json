  "description": "Can smart and innovative technologies fix global inequalities and solve contemporary social and environmental problems? Drawing on academic texts, news, popular media, and development literature, students will learn to critically analyze imaginations of technology as an apolitical solution to contemporary socio-environmental challenges and understand how the racialized and gendered targets of international development are produced and imagined."
