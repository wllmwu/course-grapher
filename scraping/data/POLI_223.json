  "description": "This graduate seminar explores distributive politics and corruption. We first investigate various distributive strategies, such as whether politicians target core or swing voters with goods, clientelism during and beyond campaigns, and shifts away from nonprogrammatic politics. We then examine corruption, covering topics such as grand corruption, petty corruption, and causes and consequences of corruption. The course focuses on developing countries with some comparisons to advanced economies."
