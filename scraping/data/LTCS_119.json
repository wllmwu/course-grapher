  "description": "(Cross-listed with CGS 119.) The course explores the politics of pleasure in relation to the production, reception, and performance of Asian American identities in the mass media of film, video, and the internet. The course considers how the \u201cdeviant\u201d sexuality of Asian Americans (e.g., hypersexual women and emasculated men) does more than uniformly harm and subjugate Asian American subjects. The texts explored alternate between those produced by majoritarian culture and the interventions made by Asian American filmmakers. Students may not receive credit for LTCS 119 and CGS 119."
