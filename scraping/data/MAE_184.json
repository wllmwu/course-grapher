  "description": "Students will develop software and methods to simulate the motion characteristics of flight vehicles. Six degree-of-freedom equations of motion will be reviewed with emphasis on computer implementation. Algorithms for data modeling, numerical integration, equilibrium, and linearization will be introduced. Three-dimensional visualization techniques will be explored for representing operator and observer viewpoints. Applications include aircraft, launch vehicles, automobiles, and marine vessels. Prerequisites: upper-division standing or consent of instructor."
