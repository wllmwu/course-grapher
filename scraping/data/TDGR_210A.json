  "description": "The actors focus on the nature of the acting process, using various exercises to stimulate imagination and to inspire instinctual choices. Later work includes improvisational and imaginative experiences to explore character and text. The class culminates in intensive scene work chosen for the particular actor to meld the improvisational approach with scripted material. The class is a combination of both actors and directors so that a common language is developed. Prerequisites: admission to the MFA program or consent of instructor.",
