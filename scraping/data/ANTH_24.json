  "description": "This course explores the diverse ways that scholars across the humanities and social sciences have defined \u201ccapitalism\u201d as their object of study. Much more than rational individuals involved in market relations, these approaches to capitalism explore such themes as sentiment, desire, meaning, deception, and habit."
