  "description": "How does where you grow up affect where you end up? This course explores \u201cwho gets what where and why\u201d by examining spatial inequalities in life chances across regions, rural and urban communities, and divergent local economies in the U.S. We will \u201cplace\u201d places within their economic, socio-cultural, and historical contexts. Readings and exercises will uncover spatial variation in inequalities by race/ethnicity, immigrant status, gender, class, and LGBTQIA status that national averages obscure. Prerequisites: upper-division standing. Will not receive credit for SOCI 183 and USP 183."
