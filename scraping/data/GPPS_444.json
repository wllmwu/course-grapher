  "description": "Why does the conduct of war often outstrip the policy maker\u2019s ability to optimize outcomes? This course is an examination of combatants, their doctrine, tactics, technology, and factors such as geography, and how these influence results on the battlefield. We will take the historical long view and ask this question in terms of the evolution of warfare as well. This course provides a contextual basis with respect to armed conflict for the policy student. Students may not earn credit for GPPS 444 and the GPGN 490 course with the same title."
