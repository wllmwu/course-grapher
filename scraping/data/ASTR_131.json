  "description": "Exploration of how to obtain energy from the nucleus by fission and fusion and explores the science and technology of nuclear energy and its various applications. Students will learn how stars and nuclear reactors work and be introduced to the development of controlled fusion. Topics include fundamentals of nuclei and nuclear physics, energetics of fission and fusion, basics of nuclear reactor design and technology, and elements of the physics of controlled fusion. Prerequisites: PHYS 2A/2AR-B-C-D or 4A-B-C-D-E.",
