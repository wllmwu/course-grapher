  "description": "Experimental/constitutive modeling perspectives on mechanical, hydraulic, thermal behavior of dry and saturated soils. Experimental techniques and methodologies presented; students will be able to perform key tests. Behavior of saturated sands and clays described based on key studies. Calibration of constitutive models for stress-strain behavior of soils, including hyperbolic, Mohr-Coulomb/Cam-Clay models. Modification of these models to consider thermal effects.\u00a0Prerequisites: graduate standing."
