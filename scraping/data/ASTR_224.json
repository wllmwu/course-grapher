  "description": "Surveys dynamical processes in astrophysical systems on scales ranging from planets to cosmology, including stability and evolution of planetary orbits, scattering processes and the few-body problem, processes in stellar clusters with smooth and cusped potentials, axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric potentials, angle-action formalism, bar and spiral structure formation, tidal streams, galactic collisions, interactions between matter and dark matter, and evolution of large-scale structure. Renumbered from PHYA 233. Students may not receive credit for both ASTR 224 and PHYA 233."
