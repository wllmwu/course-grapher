  "description": "This course examines performances from Latinx America that address issues of immigration, sexual politics, and gender, racial, and economic inequality among other topics. Students learn about how artists and communities use performance to explore a wealth of cultural practices and identities that have emerged alongside, and often in response to, the historical conditions that shape the disparate yet interconnected experiences of Latinx people living in the U.S. (colonialism, slavery, imperialism). Cross-listed with ETHN 133. Students may receive credit for one of the following: TDHT 111 or ETHN 133. No prior knowledge in theatre history is needed. Prerequisites: upper-division standing or consent of instructor.\u00a0"
