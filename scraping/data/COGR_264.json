  "description": "This course introduces students to feminist scholarship by providing a theoretical and political history of the field. It considers the ways in which such scholarship has expanded, in part due to contests over the basis of feminist knowledge production. It takes into account points of contention and dialogue highlighting challenges from Black, indigenous, people of color, and queer theorists, including demands for attention to factors like intersectionality and performativity. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
