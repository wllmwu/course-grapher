  "description": "Introductory programming using an object-oriented approach with the Java programming language. Builds on basic programming constructs introduced in CSE 8A to introduce class design and use, interfaces, basic class hierarchies, recursion, event-based programming, error reporting with exceptions, and file I/O. Basics of command-line navigation for file management and running programs. Development, testing, and debugging of more complex programs. CSE 8B is part of a two-course sequence (CSE 8A-B) that is equivalent to CSE 11. No credit offered for CSE 8B if CSE 11 taken previously. Students may not receive credit for CSE 8B and CSE 11. Students should consult the \u201cCSE Course Placement Advice\u201d web page for assistance in choosing which CSE course to take first Prerequisites: CSE 8A; restricted to undergraduates. Graduate students will be allowed as space permits.",
