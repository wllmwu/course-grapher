  "description": "This course will examine the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939), from its long- and short-term causes, to the military conflict, the war\u2019s internationalization, the violence perpetrated against civilians, the ideological stakes, the struggles of everyday life for the population, and the divided memory of the war that still inflames passions today. The course will view the war both through a Spanish lens and as a case study of broader trends including modern civil wars and the interwar European crisis."
