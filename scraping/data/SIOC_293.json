  "description": "We will examine the general structure of the ocean and atmosphere and consider processes and interactions that contribute to climate variability. We will describe dominant climate modes of variability, such as ENSO, and evaluate processes driving climate changes on longer timescales, such as ice ages and deglaciation. Finally, we will explore how climate system processes and feedbacks modulate the impacts of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and how they may be impacted in a warming climate. Prerequisites: SIOC 290S and graduate standing or consent of instructor.",
