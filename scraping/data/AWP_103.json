They will then weigh in, composing their own strategic arguments. Students will also make short multi-modal presentations to practice delivering what they have written. The intensive focus on writing and revising is especially useful for students who want to develop their writing. This course fulfills the undergraduate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) requirement. Prerequisites: upper-division or graduate standing."
