  "description": "In this remote course, students use writing to explore and to create a professional identity. Assignments range from articulating the questions and problems that students hope to explore in their professional lives to understanding the current conversations in their chosen professions, and to fashioning resumes, cover letters, and presentations that declare what they hope to contribute professionally. The intensive focus on writing and revising is especially useful for students who want to develop their writing. Students may not receive credits for AWP 102 and AWP 102R. Prerequisites: upper-division or graduate standing."
