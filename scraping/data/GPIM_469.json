  "description": "Fears about the impact of automation on work are old, but the advent of \u201csmart machines\u201d and artificial intelligence have created new concerns. Many categories of work previously done by humans are newly vulnerable to replacement. What are the forces driving these changes? What technological advances make new technology possible? What tasks cannot be done by machines? Topics of the class include artificial intelligence, machine learning, worker safety nets, competition, and others. Students may not earn credit for GPIM 469 and GPGN 490 with the same title."
