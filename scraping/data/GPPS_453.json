  "description": "Course explores the complex, dynamic, and asymmetrical bilateral relations between the U.S. and Mexico. Topics include immigration, trade, security, the border, and energy. We will go beyond theory to favor a policy-making approach and consider the decision-making processes on both sides of the border and the alternatives officials often seek. Students may not receive credit for GPPS 453 and GPGN 490 with the same title."
