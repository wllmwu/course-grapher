  "description": "This course uses the study of language to unpack contemporary processes of human mobility across geopolitical borders. We will explore both the role of language in shaping movement and the politics of language that arise from and around these movements. Migrations to the United States will be a core theme, though we will also work to put them in comparative perspective. Ultimately, our aim will be to critically rethink all three of the title terms\u2014language, migration, and borders\u2014in tandem. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
