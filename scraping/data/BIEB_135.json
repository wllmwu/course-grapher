  "description": "Course provides overview of physical, chemical, and biological processes that characterize inland waters (lakes and rivers), estuaries, and near-shore environments. Dominant biota of lakes, rivers, and streams, and how they are related to physical and chemical processes of the systems in which they reside will be covered. Methods will be introduced for assessing the chemical composition of water and detecting organisms that affect drinking water quality and coastal water quality management. Course requires field studies. Students should expect to fully participate in field trips; transportation not provided by the university. Students must comply with all risk management policies/procedures. Material lab fees will apply. Prerequisites: upper-division standing; BILD 3 and BILD 4.",
