  "description": "This course examines the interplay between racial/ethnic identity and politics. How do race and ethnicity become politicized? What role does ethnic or racial identity play in political behavior and decision-making processes? To what extent do political institutions and institutional design reinforce the salience of ethnic or racial identity in politics? We will be taking a comparative approach to this topic, and cover readings in both American politics and comparative politics literature."
