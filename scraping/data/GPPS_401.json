  "description": "Post-2003 civil wars are different from previous ones in striking ways. First, the majority are situated in Muslim-majority countries. Second, most of the rebel groups espouse radical Islamist ideas. Third, of these groups, most are pursuing transnational rather than national goals. Current theory explains a great deal, but not everything. For example, it does not account for information and communication technology. These innovations are critical to understanding the new civil wars. Renumbered from IRGN 401. Students may not receive credit for GPPS 401 and IRGN 401."
