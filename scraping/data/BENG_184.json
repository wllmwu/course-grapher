  "description": "(Cross-listed as BIMM 184, CSE 184, and CHEM 184.) This advanced course covers the application of machine learning and modeling techniques to biological systems. Topics include gene structure, recognition of DNA and protein sequence patterns, classification, and protein structure prediction. Pattern discovery, hidden Markov models/support vector machines/neural network/profiles, protein structure prediction, functional characterization of proteins, functional genomics/proteomics, metabolic pathways/gene networks. Prerequisites: BENG 181 or BIMM 181 or CSE 181; BENG 182 or BIMM 182 or CSE 182 or CHEM 182; bioinformatics majors only. (S)",
