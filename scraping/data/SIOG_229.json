  "description": "Introduction to potential theory with applications to gravity and geodesy. Topics include the geoid, spherical harmonics, Laplace\u2019s equation, the Dirichlet problem on a sphere. Coordinate systems, reference ellipsoids and tides are discussed, together with geodetic underpinnings of GPS/GNSS, and absolute and relative observations of Earth surface deformation. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor. (S/U grades permitted.)"
