  "description": "This course examines the histories of knowledge, ideas, and intellectuals in Africa. We will broadly define an intellectual, analyzing the lives and works of writers, scholars, healers, scientists, revolutionaries, and artists. We will tackle questions such as who is an intellectual, what is knowledge, and how is it produced, transmitted, and transformed? We will explore how Africans have understood and generated knowledge of diverse topics that have shaped their world and the broader world."
