  "description": "The U.S. President is a key political actor whose words, actions, and influence are of interest to foreign leaders, domestic politicians, journalists, scholars, and the American public. But how do presidents wield their power? How do they influence legislators, bureaucrats, the parties, and the public? Who do they represent? In this course, graduate students will begin to answer these questions and gain an understanding of gaps in the current literature as they develop their own projects."
