  "units": "4",
  "dept": "CHEM",
  "anchor": "chem265",
  "description": "The resolution revolution in cryo-electron microscopy has made this a key technology for the high-resolution determination of structures of macromolecular complexes, organelles, and cells. The basic principles of transmission electron microscopy, modern cryo-electron microscopy, image acquisition, and 3-D reconstruction will be discussed. Examples from the research literature using this state-of-the-art technology will also be discussed. May be coscheduled with CHEM 165. Students may not receive credit for BGGN 262 and CHEM 265. Prerequisites: graduate standing. (May not be offered every year.)"
