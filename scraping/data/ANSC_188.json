  "description": "This course looks at how illness, health, and healing are understood and experienced in contexts where they are not defined merely as physiological problems, but are seen as having important spiritual, aesthetic, and sociopolitical dimensions. We will look at the role of traditional healers, such as shamans; how cultures vary in what they consider to be the forces that lead to illness; what forms illness takes; and how we evaluate the effectiveness of healing practices. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
