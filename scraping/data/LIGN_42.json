  "description": "A great meme can perfectly capture your feelings, sum up a situation, leave you laughing, or just add a bit of spice to life. In this course, we\u2019ll look at memes as an aspect of modern communication, discussing the concept of a \u201cmeme,\u201d the life cycle of a meme, the social nature of memes, and more, all explored using tools and concepts from language and the field of linguistics. This study will show that memes aren\u2019t just silliness, but a rich communicative medium for a modern multimedia era."
