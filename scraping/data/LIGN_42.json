  "description": "The internet is a wonderful new frontier of language use. In this course, we\u2019ll use linguistic theory to analyze the many unique linguistic phenomena which have arisen there, ranging from the linguistic richness of memes, to cross-community differences in language use, to keysmashing, emoji, new words, and more. Ultimately, our goal will be to show that all language, no matter where it arises, is valid, fascinating, and worthy of study."
