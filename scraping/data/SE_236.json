  "description": "Propagation of elastic waves in thin structural elements such as strings, rods, beams, membranes, plates, and shells. An approximate strength-of-materials approach is used to consider propagation of elastic waves in these elements and obtain the dynamic response to transient loads. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
