  "description": "Introduction to computational methods in astrophysics. Topics include numerical differentiation and integration, ordinary and partial differential equations, Monte Carlo methods, Fourier transforms, N-body algorithms, the basics of fluid dynamics, and its implementation in grid-based and smoothed-particle hydrodynamic methods. The course will include modern practical applications ranging from planet formation to cosmological structure formation.
