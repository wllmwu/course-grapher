  "description": "Introduction to computational methods in astrophysics. Topics include numerical differentiation and integration, ordinary and partial differential equations, Monte Carlo methods, Fourier transforms, N-body algorithms, the basics of fluid dynamics, and its implementation in grid-based and smoothed-particle hydrodynamic methods. The course will include modern practical applications ranging from planet formation to cosmological structure formation. Prerequisites: PHYS 2A/2AR-B-C-D or 4A-B-C-D-E and BILD 62 or COGS 18 or CSE 11 or CSE 6R or CSE 8A or CSE 8B or DSC 10 or PHYS 41.",
