  "description": "This course will acquaint students with basic concepts in jazz piano. Students will learn chord voicing, how to read a lead sheet, and modes for improvising. Major pianists from the idiom will be listened to and discussed. The course is ideal for non-pianists as well as pianists because its emphasis is theoretical, not technical. Prerequisites: MUS 2AK and 2BK or passing proficiency exam, or consent of instructor. Concurrent enrollment in MUS 2C. Majors only.",
