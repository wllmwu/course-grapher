  "description": "This course critically examines the role of race and racism in American society through a historical and sociological lens. It covers each major historical period starting with slavery and ending with our current era. Why do some historians argue that slavery preceded the ideology of racism in the United States? Did Irish immigrants become white or were they always considered white? How is the Vietnam War connected to the emergence of the contemporary white power movement? Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
