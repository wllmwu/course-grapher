  "description": "A recurrent theme in the study of subjectivity has been the subject\u2019s capacity to posit herself as such in language. This course explores both individual and collective subjectivity as emergent in a range of contextually grounded narrative practices: in news and novels, ritual verse and everyday chit-chat, songs, and cartoons. The course includes a workshop component where students will be encouraged to present material from their own research projects. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
