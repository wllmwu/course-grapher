  "description": "This course covers the basics of regenerative medicine for understanding what stem cell-targeted therapy is and what are the principles for taking a cell-based product from preclinical to first-in-human clinical studies. Topics covered include the regulatory, ethical, and study design considerations for developing stem cell-targeted therapies. Students will grasp the complexities of stem cell-targeted therapies and be able to understand the framework for developing new products. This course provides a good overview for those entering a field that may deliver stem cell therapies, stem cell-targeted treatments, or other cellular based therapies (e.g., car-t-cell).  Prerequisites: admission to the MAS Clinical Research Program or consent of department."
