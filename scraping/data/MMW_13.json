  "description": "This course presents a global perspective on the connections, exchanges, and transformations that linked Afro-Eurasia and the Americas during the period from 1200 to 1750 CE. The course examines the nature and consequences of this increasingly connected world. It focuses on spaces of cross-cultural contact and exchange, including the transfer of technologies, ideas, commodities, and customs and their environmental impact; encounters in the form of travel, trade, migration, and invasion; and exploitation through empire, colonization, and slavery, and their manifestation in state violence, intolerance, discrimination, and racism. MMW 13 is the second of two writing-intensive courses in the MMW sequence. Prerequisites: completion of MMW 12. Open to Eleanor Roosevelt College students only. Must be taken for a letter grade to meet the requirement.",
