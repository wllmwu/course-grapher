  "description": "This course is an introduction to robotic planning algorithms and programming. Topics include sensor-based planning (bug algorithms), motion planning via decomposition and search (basic search algorithms on graphs, A*), the configuration-space concept, free configuration spaces via sampling, collision detection algorithms, (optimal) planning via sampling (probabilistic trees), environment roadmaps, and filtering for robot localization and environment mapping (SLAM). Prerequisites: MAE 8, MAE 108, and senior standing or consent of instructor.",
