  "description": "An understanding of how to design and run a good experiment will position students at the cutting edge of decision-making in business and policy. Students will develop their own experiments that can be implemented online and in organizations. Students will learn to distinguish between a correlation and a causal effect; incorporate behavioral economics into experimental designs; randomize, analyze, and critique experimental interventions; and address organizational concerns about experimentation.
