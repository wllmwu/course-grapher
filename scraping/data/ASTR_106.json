  "description": "This course discusses quantum mechanical applications of astrophysical interest, with an emphasis on radiation processes. Topics include electromagnetic field and time-dependent perturbation theory, transitions, and Fermi\u2019s golden rule; absorption cross sections, selection rules, single and multi-electron atoms, and diatomic molecules, including the Born-Oppenheimer approximation; physics of the chemical bond and an introduction to the Dirac equation.
