  "description": "This is a basic course in fluid dynamics for advanced students. The course consists of core fundamentals and modules on advanced applications to physical and biological phenomena. Core fundamentals include Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, potential and Stokesian flow, instabilities, boundary layers, turbulence, and shocks. Module topics include MHD, waves, and the physics of locomotion and olfaction. May be coscheduled with PHYS 116. The performance criteria for graduate students will be to complete and pass (1) a graduate-level exam and (2) graduate-level homework problem sets. In both cases, there will be overlap with the undergraduate exam and problems, but the graduates will be expected to complete additional work at a higher level. Recommended preparation: prior coursework consistent with PHYS 100B and 110B content. Open to major codes PY75, PY76, PY77, PY78, PY79, PY80, PY81, and PY82 only. All others must use the Enrollment Authorization System (EASy) to request approval to enroll."
