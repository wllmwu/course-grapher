  "description": "Intensive coverage of modern spectroscopic techniques used to determine the structure of organic molecules. Problem solving and interpretation of spectra will be strongly emphasized. Students will be required to write and submit a paper that reviews a recent research publication that reports the structure determination by spectroscopic methods of natural products. May be coscheduled with CHEM 158. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
