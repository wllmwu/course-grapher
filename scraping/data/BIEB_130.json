  "description": "Course integrates principles of ecology and marine biology to examine marine biodiversity loss from overexploitation, habitat loss, invasion, climate change, and pollution. We examine consequences of biodiversity loss to marine ecosystems, discuss management regimes, and address global and local ocean conservation problems. Course includes basic overviews of climate, marine biology, and oceanography that may be similar to topics covered in introductory courses at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Prerequisites: BILD 3.",
