  "description": "Robotics has the potential to improve well-being for millions of people, support care givers, and aid the clinical workforce. This course brings together engineers, clinicians, and end users to explore this exciting new field. It is project-based, interactive, and hands on, and involves working closely with stakeholders to develop prototypes that solve real-world problems.\u00a0Students will explore the latest research in healthcare robotics, human-robot teaming, and health design. JSOE students should be comfortable building and experimenting within their area of expertise (e.g., CSE, software development, MAE, rapid prototyping). Students with clinical backgrounds should be familiar with translational research methods. Students may not receive credit for CSE 276D and CSE 291 (H00) taught spring 2017 with the same subtitle. Program or materials fees may apply. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
