Course topics vary; they include African American film, Latino/a film, Asian American film, films by Spike Lee, stereotypes on film, and other such topics. Students may not enroll in the same topic of TDGE 12 that they have already taken in TDGE 11, Great Performances on Film. This will count as a duplicate of credit for repeating the same film topic. May be taken for credit two times. Prerequisites: none. "
