  "description": "This graduate seminar explores clientelism and corruption. We first investigate clientelism, covering topics such as strategies during elections, the role of brokers, clientelism beyond campaigns, and shifts away from clientelism. We then examine corruption, covering topics such as grand corruption, petty corruption, and causes and consequences of corruption. The course focuses on developing countries, with some comparisons to advanced economies."
