  "description": "Melting of glaciers and ice shelves by the ocean has emerged as a driver of rapid ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica, and hence sea level rise. In turn, melting of Greenland and Antarctica impacts ocean circulation and marine ecosystems. This interdisciplinary course covers basic glacier and ice sheet dynamics, fjord and ice shelf cavity circulation, melting of ice in the ocean and the current state of observations, models and theories of ice sheet ocean interactions at both hemispheres. Recommended preparation: Some introduction to physical oceanography and introductory calculus is helpful. The course is designed for an interdisciplinary group of students. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
