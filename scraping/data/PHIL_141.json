  "description": "This course considers whether human life has meaning, and, if so, what meaning it has and under what conditions such meaning may be secured. Negative proposals considered include that life is nothing but suffering, that it is absurd, that it has no meaning. Positive proposals considered include that meaning derives from free choices, from just being, from some passion, from something transcendent, or from human relationships or purposeless play or knowledge or achievement or morality. Prerequisites: upper-division standing or consent of instructor."
