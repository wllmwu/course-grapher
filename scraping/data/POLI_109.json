  "description": "This course is designed to help students better understand the legislative process through active learning. Students will be assigned a US house representative and be asked to learn about them, their district, and their priorities. Based on this research, students will draft legislation, issue press releases and tweets, collaborate with colleagues, build coalitions, participate in committee hearings, and vote on different bills in hopes of making a positive difference for their constituents."
