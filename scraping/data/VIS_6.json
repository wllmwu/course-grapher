  "description": "We will look at works that present androids, cyborgs, and AI as an emergent \u201cother\u201d in media. Examining science fiction films and media, students look critically at how race and gender are represented. Through the lens of feminist and antiracist scholarship, the course presents critical understandings of android/AI stories and their cultural implications. Special emphasis throughout the course will be placed on how such stories remake troubling histories and anxieties about race and gender. Prerequisites: none."
