  "description": "Archaeology played a major role in the early days of the newly founded state of Israel, with many projects aimed at finding evidence for past Jewish presence in the land. Archaeological excavations, some on a national scale, were part of the creation of a new national narrative\u2014and some would argue that this role still exists today. This class will explore the connection between archaeology and modern history in the contentious land of Israel. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
