  "description": "In this seminar, we investigate gun violence from a critical perspective that draws on social and health sciences, films, media, and more. While we take the contemporary issue of gun violence in the United States as a primary case study, we employ a global and comparative perspective. We explore controversies to include cultural, gendered, ethnic, political, and economic analysis. We examine discourses on gun violence as rational/irrational, healthy/pathological, and individually or socially produced. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
