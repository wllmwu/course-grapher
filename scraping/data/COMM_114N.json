  "description": "This course concentrates on one area of law specific to the concerns of communication: the relationship between privacy, personhood, and bodily autonomy. Using a combination of legal texts, court cases, and theoretical literature, we will consider the changing nature of each dimension of this relationship as the courts have been called upon to adjudicate conflicting claims and visions in matters of reproduction, sexual identity, genetic engineering, and the commodification of body parts.
