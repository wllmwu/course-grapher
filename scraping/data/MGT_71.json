  "description": "Operating a business is a complex task but a skill that can be mastered. Business managers make interconnected decisions to bring products and services to market. How many workers should a burrito chain employ given demand projections and which burrito-building tasks should be completed before a customer walks in? When a bakery makes pastries, how many at a time? Why do airlines overbook? Managers must answer these questions to keep operations lean and outdo competitors. Students will not receive credit for both MGT 71 and MGT 71R.",
