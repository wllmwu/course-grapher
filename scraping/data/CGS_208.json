  "description": "(Cross-listed with ANTH 208.) This seminar critically examines gender variance by contrasting local and global contexts. We will interrogate Western analytical frameworks of sex, gender, and sexuality including the idea of transgenderism as a crossing from one gender to an opposite one, the distinction between gender identity and sexuality, and the assumed relationship between sex and gender in relation to other social formations and processes. Students will not receive credit for both CGS 208 and ANTH 208."
