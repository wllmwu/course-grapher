  "description": "This course examines how legislatures shape policy-making in the United States, France, and United Kingdom. We will pay particular attention to how political parties, institutional structures, and legislator incentives impact representation and policy-making within and across cases. A substantial portion of the course will require participation in a simulation which will ask students to apply theoretical insights learned in the course to advance legislation in a simulated legislature."
