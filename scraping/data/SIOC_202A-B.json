  "description": "This two-quarter sequence is designed to introduce a broad background of students to basic principles of wave physics, including generation, propagation, dispersion, refraction, diffraction, reflection, waveguides, etc. A variety of wave motions of environmental relevance, including acoustic, ocean surface and internal (SIOC 202A), optical and seismic (SIOC 202B) are used to illustrate these principles. In-class experiments, data collection, and analysis exercises are incorporated. Prerequisites: calculus and partial differential equations."
