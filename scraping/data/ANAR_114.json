  "description": "Israel, like California, is located on a complex tectonic boundary, which is responsible for a history of earthquakes, volcanism, and tsunamis. How great is the risk today and what will be the regional impact of a major earthquake? We will try to answer these questions by understanding the basic geology of Israel and reviewing the history of natural disasters as recorded by archaeology and historical documentation. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
