This theoretical and embodied course examines a selection of indigenous plays and performances (dance, hip hop) and helps students develop the critical vocabulary and contextual knowledge necessary to productively engage with the political and artistic interventions performed by these works. No prior knowledge in theatre history is needed. Students may not receive credit for TDHT 120 and ETHN 163G."
