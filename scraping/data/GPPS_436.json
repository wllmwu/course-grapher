  "anchor": "gpps436",
  "description": "This course will acquaint students with prominent theories of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism and the gap between theory and practice; content of twentieth-century ideologies that explicitly authorize terrorist violence; and readings that probe the efficacy of leadership decapitation strategies, inherent trade-offs between prevention policies and civil liberties, the problems of multiple principals, nonaccountable agents, and strategies for managing grievances. Students may not earn credit for GPPS 436 and the GPGN 490 course with the same title."
