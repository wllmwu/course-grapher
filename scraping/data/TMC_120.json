  "description": "This service-learning experience guides undergraduates in achieving a critical and reflective understanding of the impact of historical, systemic, and institutionalized inequities on educational opportunities for underrepresented students. Undergraduates contribute to educational equity efforts by volunteering as tutors or interns at a UC San Diego Partnership School. These schools prepare first-generation youth for higher education by providing a rigorous college preparatory culture and curriculum. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
