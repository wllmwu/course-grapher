  "description": "What can we learn by looking at a society\u2019s ideas about marriage, intimate relationships, and family? Why do these \u201cprivate\u201d institutions draw so much public scrutiny and debate? How are they linked to concepts of national progress, individualism, religion, status, or morality? We will explore these questions in Western and non-Western contexts through such topics as polygamy, same-sex marriage, transnational marriage, and the global impact of Western ideas of love and companionate marriage. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
