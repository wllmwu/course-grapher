  "description": "Experiments that emphasize biophysical principles through hands-on experience, with an emphasis on the blending of physical measurements with a clearly identified biological problem. Exercises include the use of optical tweezers to measure viscous forces at the level of cellular organelles, the characterization of sensorimotor control in the fly during visually guided flight, and the use of microscopic imaging techniques to characterize cell motility and organelle transport. Includes instruction in LabView. Students are encouraged to attend the PHYS 173 undergraduate lectures. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor. PHYS 120A, BILD 1, and CHEM 6CL for undergraduates."
