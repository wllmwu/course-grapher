  "description": "This seminar will examine basic approaches to the study of human development, drawing on theory, research, and methods from multiple disciplines to study how children and adults develop within the context of cultural communities. It includes discussion of cultural practices as mediators on developmental outcomes, notions of universals and diversity, and individualism and familism. We will discuss the complex ways that individual and sociocultural factors interact in learning and development."
