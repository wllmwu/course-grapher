  "description": "Bionanotechnology is defined as science and engineering that involves working with biomolecules on the nanoscale. DNA and protein-based nanostructures, or even entire microorganisms, are subject of study and development of nanomachines. Another avenue is the nanoscale bio-mimicry in which synthetic systems are engineered to mimic what nature has already achieved. Bionanotechnology finds utility in medicine, materials, the environment. Cross-listed with BENG 247C and ECE 247C.\u00a0Students may receive credit for one of the following: NANO 247C, BENG 247C, or ECE 247C. Prerequisites:\u00a0graduate standing."
