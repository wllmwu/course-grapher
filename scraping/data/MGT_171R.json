This course goes beyond cost minimization and addresses issues that firms large and small must confront in their journey toward sustained scalability, growth, and profitability. Also examines human factors such as psychological contract, team management, empowerment, employee initiated process improvements, morale, motivation, rewards, and incentives. Students will not receive credit for both MGT 171R and MGT 171. This course is a distance education course."
