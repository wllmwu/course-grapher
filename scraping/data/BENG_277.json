  "anchor": "beng-277",
  "description": "Students will learn to conduct tissue engineering and developmental biology experiments, microfabricate cell culture systems, engineer biopolymer materials, and develop and analyze quantitative models of transport, cell fate, and growth mechanics. The understanding and manipulation of multicellular processes that comprise development and growth involves specialized areas of biomechanics, developmental biology, biomaterials, and the tools of molecular biology, as well as the integration of theory and experiment. To fabricate functional tissues, it is important to establish underlying molecular and physical mechanisms and then control and integrate these. Prerequisites: consent of instructor. (W)"
