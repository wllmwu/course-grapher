  "description": "This course explores the intersectionality between migration, gender, race, and class to better understand the migrant narratives of Central American, Mexican, and Latina women in the U.S. Key concepts on gender, critical race, migration, border, and queer theory will help us to analyze contemporary cultural productions portraying the exclusion, discrimination, exploitation, exceptions, and (in)visibility that women face due to their race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and gender identity."
