  "description": "This course will focus on the period from 711 through the end of the sixteenth century, and will contrast evidence for \u201cconvivencia\u201d (multicultural coexistence) versus the history of hostility, crusade, and religious intolerance among three great cultures of medieval Spain. We will then trace the direct line from the negotiation of identity and intercultural frontiers in Spain, to the conquest of the Americas and interaction with Native Americans. Prerequisites: upper-division standing. Students must submit applications to the International Center Programs Abroad Office and be accepted into the Global Seminar Program."
