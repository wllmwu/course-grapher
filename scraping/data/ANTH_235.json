  "description": "This graduate seminar will attend to the theory and praxis of social justice. Social justice is primarily concerned with the ways in which wealth and privileges are distributed in society. This course explores the ideologies and logics of wealth distribution at various points in history and in different places across the globe. The ways in which we understand basic human needs and the distribution of entitlements are also critical components of theories of social justice. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
