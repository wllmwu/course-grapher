  "title": "The Political Economy of Foreign Aid",
  "units": "4",
  "dept": "GPS",
  "anchor": "gpps450",
  "description": "The course is designed to develop the analytical tools to assess how foreign aid is allocated and whether it is effective. We will ask the following key questions: (1) Why do states give foreign aid?; (2) Is foreign aid effective?; (3) How do donors allocate foreign aid?; (4) What are the differences between bilateral and multilateral aid?; and, (5) Are there unintended consequences of foreign aid? The readings will consist of both seminal and recent works in political science and economics. May not receive credit for GPPS 450 and the IRGN 490 with the same course title."
