  "description": "This course is an introduction to the art of writing a research proposal. We will concentrate on proposals for ethnographic fieldwork, although the skills learned will be useful for many other purposes. The proposal writing process will be broken into component parts. Class time will be spent discussing these parts in greater detail and commenting on one another\u2019s work. By the end of the quarter students will have produced a research proposal of their own. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
