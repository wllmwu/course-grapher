  "description": "Focusing on Japan and its transnational relationships, this course combines analysis of readings with instruction in writing academic research papers. Students will spend about half their time on readings and half on their own research projects. We will analyze domestic and international contexts within which Japanese cultural forms emerge and influence others. Topics include Japanese approaches to popular culture, art, environment, social relationships, and social problems. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
