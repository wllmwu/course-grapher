  "description": "How do states develop the ability to carry out public policies? This course examines forces that shape the origins of the state, its form, and ability to implement policies, such as taxation. We explore the implications of state capacity for economic development. The course highlights the importance of evidence in adjudicating between competing explanations about the causes and consequences of state capacity. Students may not receive credit for GPPS 418 and GPGN 490 with the same title."
