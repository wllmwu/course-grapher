  "description": "Cross-listed with NANO 227, MATS 227, and CHEM 222.) Key concepts in the atomic structure and bonding of solids such as metals, ceramics, and semiconductors.\u00a0Symmetry operations, point groups, lattice types, space groups, simple and complex inorganic compounds, structure/property comparisons, structure determination with X-ray diffraction. Ionic, covalent, metallic bonding compared with physical properties. Atomic and molecular orbitals, bands vs. bonds, free electron theory. Students may only receive credit for one of the following: CHEM 222, MAE 251, MATS 227, or NANO 227. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
