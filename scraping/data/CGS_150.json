  "description": "(Cross-listed with ETHN 150.) Visuality is a term for the role of the visual in power relations, the production of what we \u201csee\u201d regarding race and sexuality in everyday life. In this course, we will focus on texts that challenge colonial capitalist visuality through the centering of desire and human relationships. This course focuses on face-to-face relations and mental images rather than media representations. Students may not receive credit for CGS 150 and ETHN 150. Prerequisites: CGS 2A-B, ETHN 1, 2, 3, at least one CGS or ETHN upper-division course, or permission of the instructor.",
