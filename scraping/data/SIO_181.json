  "description": "An introduction to the biochemical and physiological mechanisms used by animals to live in marine environments. Concepts covered include enzymatic function, oxygen transport, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, pH regulation, and ion transport. Course will include examples of how these concepts apply to diverse marine animals such as mussel biochemical adaptations to hypoxia, shark blood pH regulation after feeding, marine mammal diving physiology, and metabolic adaptations of deep-sea animals. Prerequisites: none."
