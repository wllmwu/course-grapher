  "description": "We often learn through observations or from testimony from others. Occasionally, we learn simply by thinking. How do we generate insights in the absence of new information from the external world? This course examines the cognitive capacities involved in learning by thinking, including thought experiments, deduction, analogy, imagination, and learning by explaining. This discussion-based seminar will take a cognitive science approach, emphasizing cognitive development. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
