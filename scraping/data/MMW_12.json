  "description": "Covering ca. 100 BCE to 1200 CE, MMW 12 examines the development of classical empires from China to the West, their collapse, and their transformation into distinct medieval forms. It also examines the rise and spread of Christianity, Islam, and Mahayana Buddhism. This course is the first of two writing-intensive quarters in the MMW sequence. Prerequisites: satisfaction of the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Open to Eleanor Roosevelt College students only. Students may not receive credit for both MMW 12, which is the first writing-intensive six-credit course in the new MMW sequence, and MMW 2, which was the first writing-intensive course in the original MMW sequence. Must be taken for a letter grade to meet the requirement. (W)",
