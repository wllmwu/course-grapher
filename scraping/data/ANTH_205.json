  "description": "This course builds upon the question can authentic anthropology emerge from the critical intellectual traditions and counter-hegemonic struggles of Third World peoples? (Harrison 1991:1). We will analyze the rise of postcolonial and decolonial approaches across the four fields of the discipline over the past decade. In turn, we will analyze the ways a lack of attention to decolonial anthropology functions to reiterate hierarchies and oppressive systems of knowledge production. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
