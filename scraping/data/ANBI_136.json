  "description": "The human brain and the structural and functional adaptations it has undergone throughout primate evolution are responsible for the most defining characteristics of our species. This course familiarizes students with major brain structures and functions linked to human cognitive and behavioral specializations and examines the relationship between structural variation of the brain and behavior through comparative neuroanatomical studies in human neuropathologies. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
