  "description": "This is a course on the interactions of underwater light with marine plankton and animals. Topics include basic physics of interaction of light and matter, optical properties of marine plankton, optical and biological effects associated with interactions of light with marine organisms, and optical methods and their applications to the study of ocean biology. Course meetings consist of approximately 75 percent lectures by instructor and 25 percent student presentations and discussions of selected papers. Renumbered from SIO 237C. Students will not receive credit for SIOC 237C and SIO 237C. Recommended preparation: basic physics and biology. (Letter grades only.)"
