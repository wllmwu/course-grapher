  "description": "This seminar integrates a range of perspectives to understand the contexts of teaching and change. There are three main foci: 1) how the profession of teaching in PK\u201316 is shaped by factors in the broader policy, political, and social context; 2) change, change agentry, and obstacles to change in educational institutions; 3) design-based research models to effect changes in the context of teaching. An international comparative approach is critical to consider levers for educational improvement. Letter grades only. Prerequisites: restricted to PhD (ED82) and EdD (ED79) students, or consent of instructor."
