  "description": "(Cross-listed with CGS 150.) Visuality is a term for the role of the visual in power relations, the production of what we \u201csee\u201d regarding race and sexuality in everyday life. In this course, we will focus on texts that challenge colonial capitalist visuality through the centering of desire and human relationships. This course focuses on face-to-face relations and mental images rather than media representations."
