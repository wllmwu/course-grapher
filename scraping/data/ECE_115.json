  "description": "Lab-based course. Students will learn how to prototype a mechatronic solution. Topics include cheap/accessible materials and parts; suppliers; fast prototyping techniques; useful electronic sketches and system integration shortcuts. Students will learn to materialize their electromechanical ideas and make design decisions to minimize cost, improve functionality/robustness. Labs will culminate toward a fully functional robot prototype for demonstration. Prerequisites: ECE 16 or consent of instructor.",
