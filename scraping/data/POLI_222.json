  "description": "This course examines how gender, gender norms, and women influence conflict processes. In this course, we seek to better understand the causes and consequences of women\u2019s participation in the recruitment, execution, and resolution of intrastate and interstate conflict. We ask several related questions including, how and why does women\u2019s participation in politics matter? We also examine how different gender norms influence patterns of conflict in the global context."
