  "description": "This course will sketch the lineaments of material culture studies, a field in the arena of visual studies that engages the issue, broadly framed, of how people and things interact. We will approach the topic on two levels: with a critical reading of the work of major thinkers, and with case studies based on the interests and expertise of the course leader. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
