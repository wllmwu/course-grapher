  "description": "This course will introduce students to informal institutions, focusing on cooperation, common pool resources problems, and the informal governance of groups. The analysis of informal institutions is critical to good policy design as it forces designers to formalize assumptions about salient actors, their incentives, and the choices available, while also recognizing that there may be competition for behavioral influence from non-government actors."
