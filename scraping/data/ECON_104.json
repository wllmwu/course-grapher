  "description": "The prevailing paradigm in economics is self-interest, but what if acting unselfishly is what is in your self-interest? We will explore economic questions from the viewpoint that individuals have moral values that guide how they live. This allows us to address issues like fairness, love, marriage, giving, identity, conformity, discrimination, crime, punishment, and reparations. Prerequisites: ECON 100C.",
