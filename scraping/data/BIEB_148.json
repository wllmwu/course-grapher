  "description": "Infectious diseases have devastating consequences, but vary in attributes. Using an ecological approach, the course will explore why some diseases explode in numbers, when and why new diseases emerge, how infectious disease affects plants and animals, and how can this inform conservation efforts. Students will develop a conceptual framework and quantitative tool set for answering such questions, as well as strategies for managing the emergence and spread of disease on a changing planet. Students will use their own laptops. Prerequisites: BILD 3.",
