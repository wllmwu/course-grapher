  "description": "Biodiversity is changing worldwide in response to global changes. What do these changes in biodiversity foretell for the continued provisioning of ecosystem services on which humans depend? How can we develop conservation and management strategies that preserve biodiversity, backed up by sound science? These are some of the most important questions of our time. Topics will be presented at an introductory level appropriate for students in all majors. Students will not receive credit if taken after BIEB 182."
