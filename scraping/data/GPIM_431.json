  "description": "Course examines the use of competition/antitrust policies to achieve industrial policy goals, focusing on the U.S., EU, China, Korea, and emerging markets such as India and Indonesia. We begin with a historical overview of competition and industrial policy to frame the current debate. We then examine policy regimes and how they have evolved in light of three trends: expansion of obligations under the WTO, changes in power relations within corporate sectors, and emergence of national champions. Students may not earn credit for GPIM 431 and GPGN 490 with the same title."
