  "description": "Exposure to and damages from environmental harms such as rising temperatures, air pollution, and water pollution differ across and within countries. We will understand the causes and consequences of environmental inequality and examine how environmental inequality intersects with race, income, geography, and other demographic characteristics. Students will learn competing economic theories within the growing field of environmental justice with the aim of understanding policy solutions."
