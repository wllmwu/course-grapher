The term \u201cmedieval Spain\u201d evokes popular stereotypes including that of a dark period of Islamic \u201coccupation\u201d of Christian territory and its counterpart, tolerant society of Jews, Muslims, and Christians that might serve as a model for today\u2019s world. Students will study the complexity of life in medieval Spain, discerning nuances more interesting and surprising than either of these stereotypes. Program or materials fees may apply. Students may not receive credit for HIEU 149 and HIEU 149GS. Students must apply and be accepted to the Global Seminars Program. +"
