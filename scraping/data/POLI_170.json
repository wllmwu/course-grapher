  "description": "The deployment of predictive algorithms for public policy optimization has increased in recent years across a variety of domains. This course will introduce key concepts, considerations, and concerns relating to algorithmic decision-making in policy processes. This includes understanding how data are used to make predictions, how predictions can be used to aid decision-making, the conditions under which these practices will be effective, and the important ethical dimensions of these practices.
