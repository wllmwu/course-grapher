  "description": "Communities that have experienced cumulative disadvantage from historical inequalities and injustices are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As nation-states, policymakers, school districts, teachers, and parents converge on the importance of climate education\u2014there is a need to ask what climate education ought to consist of, and to what end. This seminar will ask critical questions about climate education in the service of necessary cultural transformation for climate justice.
