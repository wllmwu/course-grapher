  "description": "Drawing insight from anti-colonial and queer of color critique, this course critically examines the demands capitalism makes on us to perform gender, and how that relates to processes of exploitation and racialization. We will explore alternatives and develop strategies for navigating jobs in this system. Students may receive credit for one of the following: CGS 120, CGS 180 and ANSC 180. CGS 120 is renumbered from CGS 180. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
