  "description": "In this course, we ask what techniques, strategies, and platforms we might engage to present these stories to a broader audience in an impactful and ethical way. While we engage with a specific web-based platform each quarter, the class maintains an emphasis on documentary storytelling and audiovisual production. The aim of this class is to demystify the idea of a \u201cmedia activist\u201d by guiding students through the development of their own media activism. Prerequisites: COMM 10 and COMM 101.",
