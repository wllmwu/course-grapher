  "description": "We study the formulations and algorithms solving convex optimization problems. The topics include convex sets, functions, optimality conditions, duality concepts, gradient descent, conjugate gradient, interior-point methods, and applications. The objective of the course is to provide students the background and techniques for scientific computing and system optimization. Students cannot receive credit for CSE 203B if they have taken either ECE 273 or MATH 245B. Prerequisites: Linear Algebra is recommended."
