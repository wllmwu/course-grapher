  "description": "Environmental systems biology is the study of the genomic basis for patterns of microbial diversity and adaptation in relation to habitat. This course introduces the microbial genome as a unit of study and surveys introductory principles in microbial genomics and bioinformatics that underlie a range of contemporary research in diverse marine habitats, such as the deep sea and polar regions, as well as studies of biomedical importance, including the human microbiome. Prerequisites: BICD 100 or BICD 100R or consent of instructor.",
