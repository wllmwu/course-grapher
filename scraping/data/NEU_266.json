  "description": "Course focuses on developmental processes during formation of neural circuits. Molecular, genetic, cellular mechanisms controlling neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, positioning (migration), axon/dendrite patterning, and synapse formation will be discussed. Role of neural activity shaping circuit formation will be explored. Prerequisites: graduate standing only. For students in the following major codes: NE75, NE78, BI77, BI79, or consent of instructor."
