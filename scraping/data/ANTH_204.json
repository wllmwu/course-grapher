  "description": "This course, intended for first-year anthropology graduate students, examines the contemporary practice of anthropology. We discuss the construction of a multiple-year research project including how to differentiate theory and evidence, the contours of anthropological interest, the question of audience, and rhetorical style. We analyze nine recent ethnographies as possible models for our own practice. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
