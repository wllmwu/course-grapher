  "anchor": "bggn262",
  "description": "The resolution revolution in cryo-electron microscopy has made this a key technology for the high-resolution determination of structures of macromolecular complexes, organelles, and cells. The basic principles of transmission electron microscopy, modern cryo-electron microscopy, image acquisition, and 3-D reconstruction will be discussed.\u00a0Examples from the research literature using this state-of-the-art technology will also be discussed. May be coscheduled with BIMM 162. Students may not receive credit for BGGN 262 and CHEM 265."
