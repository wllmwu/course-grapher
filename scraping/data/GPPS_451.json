  "description": "This course investigates how the public forms opinions about foreign policy and the various means, both direct and indirect, through which public opinion can influence the policy-making process. We consider such issues as: How does the public learn about foreign policy? Do they care about it? If so, under what circumstances will political leaders be responsive to the public\u2019s preferences? Do politics really stop at the water\u2019s edge? Should public opinion have a role in foreign policy? May not receive credit for GPPS 451 and the IRGN 490 with the same course title."
