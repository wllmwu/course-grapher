  "description": "Discussion of scaling issues and how to carry out the effective hierarchical assembly of diverse molecular and nanoscale components into higher order structures that retain the desired electronic/photonic, structural, mechanical, or catalytic properties at the microscale and macroscale levels. Novel ways to combine the best aspects of both top-down and bottom-up processes to create a totally unique paradigm change for the integration of heterogeneous molecules and nanocomponents into higher order structures. Cross-listed with NANO 205. Students may not receive credit for both CENG 215 and NANO 205.\u00a0"
