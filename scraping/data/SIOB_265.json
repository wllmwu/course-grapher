  "description": "Chemistry is the language by which most marine organisms communicate with each other and the environment. While we have yet to learn how to interpret much of this dialogue, it has become clear that natural products play pivotal roles in virtually every biotic process and interaction in the ocean. This course will broadly address the topic of marine chemical ecology, both at the macro-organism and microbiological scales. Prerequisites: graduate standing or consent of instructor."
