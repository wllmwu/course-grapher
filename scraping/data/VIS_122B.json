  "description": "This course will explore the baroque, through the lens of the lives of artists and architects who made it great: Rembrandt, Vermeer, Velasquez, Bernini, and Caravaggio, as well as the artists of the sixteenth century who served as a source of inspiration and point of departure for the great work of the baroque. The lives of these people interlocked on a number of different levels in order to create a visual culture that many regard as fundamental to the modern world. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
