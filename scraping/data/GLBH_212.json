  "description": "This course aims to discuss infectious diseases as a dynamic field of study, fruitful for global health research because it allows us to observe the interplay between power, social structures, and cultural practices that orient people\u2019s discourses and behaviors. Students will study how this imbricate set of relations configure social categories that both \u201csocialize\u201d epidemics and \u201cnaturalize\u201d social relations played out through categories such as race, ethnicity, and class. Prerequisites:\u00a0graduate-level standing."
