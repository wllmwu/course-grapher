The first part focuses on US municipal government and explores urban policy and its limits, the impulse toward reform of city government in the U.S., and the effects of reform on the distribution of power across communities. The second half of the course moves to explore local government in comparative perspective in both developed and developing countries. You will become informed consumers of state-of-the-art urban quantitative research."
