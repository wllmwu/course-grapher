  "title": "Global Corporate Accountability: Issues of Governance, Responsibility, and NGOs",
  "units": "4",
  "dept": "GPS",
  "anchor": "gppa405",
  "description": "The course explores the different mechanisms for ensuring corporations behave: boycotts, regulations, law and lawsuits, norms, NGOs, shareholder activism, markets, and competition. As the global value chain engages greater sections of the economy, the course considers how we understand the role of corporations in shaping the ethical and political issues of the environment, human rights, labor conditions, equality and opportunity, gender, and community rights. Students may not earn credit for GPPA 406 and the GPGN 490 with the same title."
