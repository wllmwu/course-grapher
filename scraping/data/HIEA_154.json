  "description": "Recognizing that the past is a multi-media process of knowledge production, this course uses a variety of films (i.e., features, shorts, and documentaries) to study how directors have visualized modern Korean history. Students will juxtapose the narratives of Korean films with academic accounts of Korean history to understand how representations of the past are produced, disseminated, contested, and interpreted. Writing exercise will develop students\u2019 critical and analytical skills."
