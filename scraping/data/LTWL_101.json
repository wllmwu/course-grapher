  "description": "Who were the Egyptians? What was life like in ancient Egypt? How did they view themselves and the world around them? To answer these questions, this course will take a whirlwind tour covering some 4,000 years. To break up our historical tour de force we will often pause to look at themes that make Egyptian civilization so worth our collective attention. This includes mythology, language and literature, the afterlife, and the legacy of ancient Egypt today. May be taken for credit up to three times as topics vary."
