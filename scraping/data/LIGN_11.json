  "description": "Everybody speaks with an accent, but not every accent is considered equal. What does your accent say about you? What does it take to imitate an accent? How does that differ from impersonating someone\u2019s voice? Are some accents simpler than others? Do singers \u201cturn off\u201d their accents? Do sign language users have accents? Are \u201cforeign\u201d accents different from other accents? We examine what accents consist of and explore how they are used to express individual identity and to signal group membership."
