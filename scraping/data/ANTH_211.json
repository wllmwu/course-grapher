The course examines the historical content of the two concepts in specific contexts. Rather than assume a cause and effect relationship, the seminar seeks to clarify understandings of what constitutes \u201cscience,\u201d \u201ccapitalism,\u201d and their relationship. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
