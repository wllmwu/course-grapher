  "title": "Partners Not Subjects: Community-Engaged Research for Anthropologists",
  "units": "4",
  "dept": "ANTH",
  "anchor": "anth228",
  "description": "Over the past decade community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods have gained traction in fields like anthropology, global health, and community development. Moreover, academic-community partnerships are key to improving health outcomes for vulnerable populations. In this graduate seminar, we will explore the history of colonialism in research practice and contrast it with emerging culturally sustainable methods where community members are treated like partners, and not subjects. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
