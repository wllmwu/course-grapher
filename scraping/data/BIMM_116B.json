  "description": "The BioClock Studio is an innovative course in which a team of undergraduate students, drawn from diverse disciplines, will work collaboratively to develop their scientific and communicative skills to produce creative educational materials that will enhance understanding of circadian biology. Students are expected to attend the annual Circadian Biology Symposium held each winter, to the extent course schedules allow, to conduct interviews with prominent scientists. BIMM 116 is not a prerequisite to enroll in BIMM 116B. May be taken for credit three times. Prerequisites: department approval required. Students will be required to formally apply to participate via an online application form and selected students will work in small teams with intensive mentoring to execute projects."
