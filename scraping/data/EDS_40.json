  "description": "This course covers diverse history and learning theories of nature-based education models spanning early childhood to adult learning. Moving through current and historical movements, students explore topics of (in)equity related to urban planning, community well-being, and health and well-being in education environments. The course features a colearning model as we learn from and with educators and community experts with a focus on historically excluded voices (including children themselves)."
