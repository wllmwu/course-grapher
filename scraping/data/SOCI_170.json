How are discrepancies between what scientists assume about gender and sexual difference reconciled with evidence to the contrary? How have ideas changed over time? Topics range from sex differences in health outcomes, intersexuality, neuroplasticity, environmental exposure, and sports medicine. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
