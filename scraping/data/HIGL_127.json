  "description": "Sport in all of its social, cultural, political, and economic aspects. The starting point will be the emergence of modern sport in nineteenth-century Britain, but the focus will be global. Since the approach will be topical rather than chronological, students should already have a good knowledge of world history in the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries."
