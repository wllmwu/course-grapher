  "description": "This course is designed to give students an understanding of the science behind numerical dating techniques in geological, archaeological, and environmental science contexts. This course will provide a background in the physics of radioactive decay and natural radiation sources and the geochemistry necessary for measurement that are critical to radiometric dating methods, and nonradiometric alternatives. Prerequisites: graduate standing."
