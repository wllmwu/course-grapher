  "description": "A practice seminar for developing performance-oriented artistic strategies and elements of sound, rhythm, and atmosphere. Open to all approaches to performing. The class is organized as a test site, oriented toward experimentation. Each student will create or refine an existing work, presenting in class, focusing on the crafting of stage presence, character, and voice, and exploring styles of delivery and forms of address. Histories of performance art and theories of performativity are studied."
