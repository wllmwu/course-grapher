  "description": "This course explores principles and design rules for the neuronal circuits that underlie animal behavior. We provide an analytical path from the dynamics of single neurons to different forms of neuronal computations. Classic and contemporary experimental studies serve as examples, and aspects of applied mathematics and experimental techniques are discussed as appropriate. Recommended preparation: a working knowledge of ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, statistical mechanics (at the level of PHYS 140A), and electrical circuits (at the level of PHYS 100B)."
