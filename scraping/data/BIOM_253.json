  "description": "This course will examine the innate and adaptive immune responses of humans to microbial infection. In parallel, we will explore the virulence mechanisms through which certain medically important viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites subvert host defense to produce infectious disease. Emphasis will be placed on basic molecular genetic and cellular approaches to understanding microbial pathogenesis and host susceptibility, including progress toward novel antibiotic and immune stimulatory therapies. Prerequisites: BIOM 200A-B, 201. Limited to BMS graduate students except by consent of instructor.",
