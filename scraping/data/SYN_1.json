  "description": "Synthesis 1 asks students to critically examine through an interdisciplinary and antiracist lens how we communicate about the climate crisis in order to address the question of how we get people to respond and take action. Through a variety of assignments and activities, students develop an awareness of both the message of a text and how the author crafted that message. They learn how to assess the purpose, audience, and context of different rhetorical situations. Prerequisites: Seventh College students only, completion of UC Entry Level Writing requirement, must be taken for a letter grade to count toward Seventh College general-education requirements. Duplicate credit with SYN 1R.",
