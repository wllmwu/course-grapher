  "description": "This fully online course explores the relationship between economy and society, with special attention (theoretically and empirically) to the problem of contemporary inequality. The course will investigate the way networks, institutions, and cultures constitute the economic world; the role of class, gender, and race in reproducing and justifying economic inequality; the rise of markets and financialization; and theoretically-informed alternatives to contemporary economic systems. Prerequisites: upper-division standing. Will not receive credit for SOCI 121R and SOCI 121 or SOCI 121R and SOCC 121."
