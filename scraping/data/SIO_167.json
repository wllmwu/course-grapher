  "description": "As specialists in human timescales, archaeologists are trained to identify subtle details that are often imperceptible for other geoscientists. This course is designed to train archaeologists to identify the natural processes affecting the archaeological record, and geoscientists to identify the influence of human behavior over land surfaces. The course, which includes lectures, laboratory training, and field observations, focuses on the articulation of sedimentology and human activity. Students may not receive credit for both ANAR 167 and SIO 167.\u00a0Recommended preparation: SIO 50 or similar on the evolution of the solid earth\u2019s surface and interior with laboratories and fieldwork. ANTH 3 or similar that examines methods used to investigate the origins of human culture and its materiality. Knowledge of digital heritage.\u00a0Prerequisites: junior, senior, or graduate standing or consent of instructor."
