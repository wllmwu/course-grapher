  "description": "This class examines different narratives of the environment from Latin America. Students are exposed to a variety of cultural sources (film, literature, orality) that question the Western divide between culture and nature, and between humans and non-humans. Particular emphasis will be paid to indigenous and Afro-Latin American ways of understanding nature, culture, and knowledge."
