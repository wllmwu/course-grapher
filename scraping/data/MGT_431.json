  "description": "Organizations are fundamentally political entities, and power and influence are key mechanisms by which things are accomplished. This course will encourage you to think about and develop your own personal path to power which can, of course, include a path away from power. Power is a topic that can make people uncomfortable, but it is a critical part of organizational life and this course will provide a safe space to work through this discomfort. Prerequisites: MBA student or by department approval."
