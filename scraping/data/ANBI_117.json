  "description": "From fragments of ancient DNA discovered in the pigment of 50,000-year-old cave paintings, to the remains of Neanderthal bones buried in caves, the potential to extract DNA from ancient human remains has revolutionized the study of human prehistory and evolution. In this course we will focus on technological benchmarks that have allowed the interpretation of ancient genomes. Some highlights include evidence of ancient hominid-human mixing and the spread of farming and languages across the globe. Prerequisites: upper-division standing."
